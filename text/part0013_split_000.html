  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.</i> — <span class="small">Numbers 31.15-18</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">The moral of Numbers is this: Don’t whine.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Miriam complains about Moses’ Ethiopian wife, and God gives her leprosy. The people complain about their hardships during the Exodus, and God sends a fire to burn them alive. They complain about the food, so God forces them to eat quails until it comes out of their noses and then he sends a plague for complaining about that. They complain again, and God sends fiery serpents to bite and kill them. God can’t stand a whiner.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">But Numbers has a something for everyone. From talking donkeys to the law of jealousies, it’s a fun book to read.</p>
