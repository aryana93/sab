  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 Therefore have <span class="bold">I also made you contemptible and base before all the people</span>, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.9) “I also made you contemptible and base before all the people.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for <span class="bold">Judah</span> hath profaned the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and <span class="bold">hath married the daughter of a strange god.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and <span class="bold">let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (3.1, 4.5) “Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me.” The gospel of Mark claims that John the Baptist fulfilled the prophecy given in Malachi. But the Malachi prophecy says that God will send Elijah before “the great and dreadful day of the LORD” in which the world will be consumed by fire. Yet John the Baptist flatly denied that he was Elijah (Elias) in John 1.21 and the earth was not destroyed after John’s appearance.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ sope:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.9) <span class="bold">“Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me.”</span> God curses the Israelites for “robbing” him by not paying the proper amount of money in tithes.</p>
