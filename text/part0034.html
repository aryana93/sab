  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">Jerusalem hath grievously sinned … they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. Her filthiness is in her skirts.</i> — <span class="small">Lamentations 1.8-9</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Well, I can find nothing good in Lamentations, but there’s plenty of evil.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">For example:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">Jerusalem is compared to a naked woman who sighs and turns backward. “Her filthiness is in her skirts.” <a href="part0034.html#lam1-8">1.8-9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Jerusalem is as a menstrous woman.” (To God this is an insult.) <a href="part0034.html#lam1-17">1.17</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“He hath bent his bow like an enemy … and slew all that were pleasant to the eye … he poured out his fury like fire.” <a href="part0034.html#lam2-4">2.4</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God mercilessly kills everyone, young and old. He even causes women to eat their children. <a href="part0034.html#lam2-20">2.20-22</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He is like a bear or a lion who secretly pursues you and then tears you apart. <a href="part0034.html#lam3-10">3.10-11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He shoots people with his bow and breaks their teeth with stones. <a href="part0034.html#lam3-13">3.13-16</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?” <a href="part0034.html#lam3-38">3.38</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.” <a href="part0034.html#lam3-44">3.44</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He “accomplishes his fury” on the Israelites by starving children to death and forcing their mothers to eat them. <a href="part0034.html#lam4-4">4.4-11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom … Thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.” <a href="part0034.html#lam4-21">4.21</a></li>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.</p>
