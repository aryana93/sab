  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">I have sent among you the pestilence … your young men have I slain with the sword … I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils, yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.</i> — <span class="small">Amos 4.10</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Most people don’t know this, but God is a pyromaniac. In the first two chapters of Amos alone, he sets, or threatens to set, seven cities on fire. He seems quite proud of it too, saying, “shall there be evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?” (Amos 3.6)</p>
