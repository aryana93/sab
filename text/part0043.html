  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile.</i> — <span class="small">Nahum 3.6</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">There’s not much new in Nahum. God continues to behave in a way that would be unacceptable for any human. But God can get away with anything.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are a few highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">God is jealous and gets furious. He takes vengeance on his adversaries and wrath on his enemies. <a href="part0043.html#nahu1-2">1.2</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Whirlwinds, tornadoes, earthquakes, and fires are caused by God and are signs of his anger. He dries up oceans and rivers, melts mountains, and throws stones. “The clouds are the dust of his feet.” <a href="part0043.html#nahu1-3">1.3-6</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God doesn’t just get even. He drowns or burns to death his enemies. <a href="part0043.html#nahu1-8">1.8-10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">There is “much pain in all loins.” <a href="part0043.html#nahu2-10">2.10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God will “discover thy skirts upon thy face … show the nations thy nakedness … and cast abominable filth upon thee.” <a href="part0043.html#nahu3-5">3.5-6</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He punished Nineveh by enslaving the people and smashing the little children in the streets. <a href="part0043.html#nahu3-10">3.10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women.” I guess this (“You’re all just a bunch of women.”) was the biggest insult God could think of at the moment. <a href="part0043.html#nahu3-13">3.13</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God says that “the fire shall devour thee, the sword shall cut thee off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm.” <a href="part0043.html#nahu3-15">3.15</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1:8) <span class="bold">“With an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 For while they be folden together as thorns, and <span class="bold">while they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1:10) <span class="bold">“While they are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the LORD, a wicked counsellor.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many, yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightnings.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.</p>
