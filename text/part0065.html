  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">In the last days … shall be … silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</i> — <span class="small">2 Timothy 3.1-7</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Like the other Pastoral Epistles (1 Timothy and Titus), 2 Timothy was written by someone who claimed to be Paul, but wasn’t. It was written by an unknown author long after the real Paul had died.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">There’s nothing very exciting in this one, but here are a few things of that might be of interest:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">“If we deny him, he also will deny us.” (Fair is fair!) <a href="part0065.html#tims2-12">2.12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">The devil can take us captive any time he pleases. <a href="part0065.html#tims2-26">2.26</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">In the last days, people will become evil, “without natural affection,” and “silly women” who are “ever learning” will be “led away with divers lusts.” <a href="part0065.html#tims3-1">3.1-7</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“All scripture is given by the inspiration of God.” <a href="part0065.html#tims3-16">3.16</a> Even Leviticus <a href="part0012_split_001.html#lev20-13">20.13</a>, Judges <a href="part0016.html#jud19-22">19.22-30</a> and Ezekiel <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze23-20">23.20</a>?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1121">2 TIMOTHY 1</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="tims1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> <span class="bold">Paul</span>, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 <span class="bold">To Timothy</span>, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.1-2) <span class="bold">“Paul … to Timothy”</span> Although Second Timothy claims to have been written by Paul, most scholars believe that it was written by someone else long after his death.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="tims1-7">7 For <span class="bold">God hath not given us the spirit of fea</span>r; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.7) “God hath not given us the spirit of fear.”<br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con132">132 Should we fear God?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="tims1-9">9 <span class="bold">Who hath saved us</span>, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but <span class="bold">according to his own purpose and grace</span>, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.9) “Who hath saved us … according to his own purpose and grace.” God selected us to be either saved or damned, and there isn’t a damned thing we can do about it.<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1122">2 TIMOTHY 2</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="tims2-1"><span class="drop-cap">2</span> Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="tims2-8">8 Remember that <span class="bold">Jesus Christ of the seed of David</span> was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.8) <span class="bold">“Jesus Christ of the seed of David”</span><br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00027.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.12-18)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="tims2-12">12 If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: <span class="bold">if we deny him, he also will deny us</span>:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.12) <span class="bold">“If we deny him, he also will deny us.”</span> (Fair is fair!)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="tims2-16">16 But <span class="bold">shun profane and vain babblings</span>: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.16) “Shun profane and vain babblings.” Shun non-believers and other profane babblers.<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">17 And <span class="bold">their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus</span>;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.17) <span class="bold">“Their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.18) <span class="bold">“Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, <span class="bold">The Lord knoweth them that are his.</span> And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.19) <span class="bold">“The Lord knoweth them that are his.”</span> This verse was used by the Catholic Church during the inquisition to justify killing those suspected of heresy. (“Kill them all, for `the Lord knows them that are His’.”)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but <span class="bold">be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
