  <h3 class="chaph1" id="chap57">PHILEMON</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">The bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</i> — <span class="small">Philemon 7</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">This short letter was written by Paul to his slave-owner friend and fellow believer, Philemon. Paul was writing about Onesimus, whom he had recently converted, and who happened to also be a runaway slave belonging to Philemon. Since Paul was in a position of authority among believers, this would have been a great opportunity for him (and God) to condemn slavery—if he (and God) had anything against it, that is. But apparently he didn’t. Instead he returned the slave to his owner without so much as a word against the institution of slavery.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">The only other thing of interest in this letter is the rather strange expression, “refresh my bowels in the Lord.” Okay, I know that Paul’s bowel trouble is just an artifact of the King James translation. But it sounds too funny to pass up.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1128">PHILEMON 1</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="phil1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, 2 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00029.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (7, 12, 20) Refreshing the bowels of the saints in the Lord</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because <span class="bold">the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(7) <span class="bold">“The bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 Yet for love’s sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="phil1-10">10 <span class="bold">I beseech thee for my son Onesimus</span>, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 <span class="bold">Whom I have sent</span> again: thou therefore <span class="bold">receive him, that is, mine own bowels</span>:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (10-12a) “I beseech thee for my son Onesimus … Whom I have sent.” Paul returned the runaway slave, Onesimus, to his “rightful owner,” Philemon, asking him to receive him just as though he were Paul’s very “own bowels.” This was, of course, a great opportunity for Paul (and God) to condemn slavery—if he had anything against it, that is. But he didn’t. So he returned the slave to his owner without a word against the institution of slavery.<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(12b) <span class="bold">“Receive him, that is, mine own bowels.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: <span class="bold">refresh my bowels in the Lord.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(20) “Refresh my bowels in the Lord.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">21 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
