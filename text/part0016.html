  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.</i> — <span class="small">Judges 19.29</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Judges is a violent book, even by biblical standards. It begins by cutting off the thumbs and big toes of a captured king and ends with a genocide following the dismemberment of a concubine’s body. Along the way it describes, with apparent relish and approval, a gruesome “message from God” (a knife blade stuck deeply into a fat man’s belly); a tent stake driven through a sleeping man’s skull; a couple of severed heads delivered to Gideon; the killing of 69 brothers upon a single stone; a daughter killed by her father as a sacrifice to God; 300 foxes tied together by their tails and lit on fire; 1000 men killed with a jawbone of an ass; and, in what is probably the most disgusting story in all literature, the rape, death and mutilation of the Levite’s concubine. And I’ve left a lot out. Read it yourself, if you have a strong enough stomach, that is.</p>

  After Joshua died, the Israelites wondered who was going to do their killing for them. God told them not to worry; he had selected the tribe of Judah to kill the Canaanites and steal their land. The first killing was easy, since God delivered them into their hand, killing 10,000 Canaanites and Perizzites. After the slaughter, they capture Adonibezek and “cut off his thumbs and great toes” to pay him back for doing the same to seventy other kings. (Abonibezek fed his table scraps to seventy thumbless and big toe-less kings who lived under his dinner table.)<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> Now <span class="bold">after the death of Joshua</span> it came to pass, that <span class="bold">the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And Judah went up; and <span class="bold">the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jud1-6">6 <span class="bold">But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jud1-9">9 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</p>

  After the Jerusalem Massacre “the children of Judah” go on a God-assisted killing spree, wiping out entire kingdoms “with the edge of the sword.” It’s hard to say how many cities were massacred, but there were at least five: three in Hebron, along with Zephath and Bethel. And there would have been a lot more, too, if it weren’t for those damned iron chariots (v.19). Some things are just too hard, even for God.<br class="calibre9"/>
  God’s 41st Killing</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">These killings also contain an important message about Biblical Family Values. In verses 12 and 13, God’s special hero (Caleb) gave his daughter to the man who could kill the most people. Now that’s family values for you!</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jud1-10">10 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And <span class="bold">Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher</span>, and taketh it, to him <span class="bold">will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 <span class="bold">And Othniel</span> the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, <span class="bold">took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00024.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.12-13) <span class="bold">“Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher … will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. And Othniel … took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.”</span> Caleb offers to give his daughter to whoever conquers the city of Debir. Caleb’s nephew wins the contest and is given his cousin for a prize.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and <span class="bold">they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.</span> And the name of the city was called Hormah.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jud1-19">19 <span class="bold">And the LORD was with Judah</span>; and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain; but <span class="bold">could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled thence the three sons of Anak.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.21-29) <span class="bold">“The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem … neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites.”</span> God promised many times that he would drive out all the inhabitants of the lands they encountered. (Ex 33.2; Dt 7.1, 7.24, 9.4-6, 31.3-7; Jos 1.1-5, 3.10, 17.17-18, 21.43-45) But these verses show that God failed to keep his promise since he was unable to drive out the Canaanites.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">21 And <span class="bold">the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem</span>; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Beth-el: and the LORD was with them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Beth-el. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And <span class="bold">when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all his family.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">26 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 <span class="bold">Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.27) <span class="bold">“Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">28 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jud1-29">29 <span class="bold">Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites</span> that dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.29) <span class="bold">“Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">30 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them out.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became tributaries unto them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">34 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain: for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">35 But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became tributaries.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">36 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</p>

  An angel drops by to rebuke the Israelites for being too tolerant of the religious beliefs of the people they have been massacring. He tells them that since they didn’t complete their job (of killing everyone), God will not completely drive them out (like he promised to do). Instead he’ll keep some of them around so that the Israelites will be ensnared by their false gods. When the Israelites heard the angel’s words, they “lifted up their voices, and wept.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 And <span class="bold">the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim:</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jud2-14">14 And <span class="bold">the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel</span>, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, <span class="bold">and he sold them into the hands of their enemies</span> round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto them: and they were greatly distressed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but <span class="bold">they went a whoring after other gods</span>, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00029.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.17) “They went a whoring after other gods.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">18 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died:</p>

  God’s 46th Killing</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">This story is more interesting than most, though, because one of the characters is named Barak. (Although Barack Obama’s first name is not derived from this biblical character, believers sometimes like to pretend otherwise.)</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">Here are the details:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">After Ehud dies, a woman became the leader of the Israelites. Her name is Deborah and she is called a prophetess and judge. She sat under a palm tree and everyone “came up to her for judgment.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="jud4-1"><span class="drop-cap">4</span> And <span class="bold">the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD</span>, when Ehud was dead.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jud4-2">2 And <span class="bold">the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan</span>, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And <span class="bold">the children of Israel cried unto the LORD</span>: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And <span class="bold">Deborah, a prophetess</span>, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And she <span class="bold">dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah</span> between Ramah and Beth-el in mount Ephraim<span class="bold">: and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(4.4-5) <span class="bold">“Deborah, a prophetess, … dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah … and the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.”</span> One day, she summoned Barak and told him to take 10,000 soldiers to fight Sisera.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 And <span class="bold">she sent and called Barak</span> the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, <span class="bold">and said</span> unto him, Hath not <span class="bold">the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying</span>, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and <span class="bold">take with thee ten thousand men</span> of the children of Naphtali and of the children of Zebulun?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And I will draw unto thee <span class="bold">to</span> the river Kishon <span class="bold">Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army</span>, with his chariots and his multitude; <span class="bold">and I will deliver him into thine hand.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(4.6-7) <span class="bold">“She sent and called Barak … and said … the LORD God of Israel commanded, saying … take with thee ten thousand men … to … Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army … and I will deliver him into thine hand.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 And Barak said unto her, <span class="bold">If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">Barak, who was a bit of a chicken shit, said: (4.8) “If thou wilt go with me, then I will go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.” Deborah said that she would go with him and that God would deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 And she said<span class="bold">, I will surely go with thee</span>: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; <span class="bold">for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman</span>. <span class="bold">And Deborah arose, and went with Barak</span> to Kedesh.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(4.9) <span class="bold">“I will surely go with thee … for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jud4-11">11 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of <span class="bold">Hobab the father in law of Moses</span>, had severed himself from the Kenites, and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jud4-13">13 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even <span class="bold">nine hundred chariots of iron</span>, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">So Deborah and Barak go off to fight in God’s holy war. Guess what happens.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And <span class="bold">the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(4.15) <span class="bold">“The LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 <span class="bold">But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host</span>, unto Harosheth of the Gentiles: <span class="bold">and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(4.16) <span class="bold">“But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host… and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.”</span> That’s right. God confused (“discomfited”) Sisera’s army, forcing them to either kill each other or kill themselves. No one survived—except Sisera, and God will take care of him in his next killing.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jud4-17">17 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</p>

  Here’s a story about Gideon. You know, the guy they named the Bible after.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">It starts out in the usual way. The Israelites do evil in the sight of the Lord (6.1); God forces the Israelites to be slaves (6.1b) ; the Israelites cry out to God (6.7); God kills the guys he delivered them to. (7.22) (The Midianites this time around. See Judges 2.14, 3.8, and 10.7 for other versions of the same story.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="jud6-1"><span class="drop-cap">6</span> And <span class="bold">the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.1) <span class="bold">“The children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jud6-5">5 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and <span class="bold">they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number</span>: and they entered into the land to destroy it.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (6.5) <span class="bold">“They came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number.”</span> Every male Midianite was killed during the time of Moses (Numbers 31.7), and yet 200 years later they flourish like grasshoppers “without number.”<br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con143">143 Did the Israelites kill every male in Midian?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And it came to pass, when <span class="bold">the children of Israel cried unto the LORD</span> because of the Midianites,</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.7) <span class="bold">“The children of Israel cried unto the LORD.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (6.11-12) An angel was sitting under an oak tree when he saw Gideon threshing some wheat. So he started up a conversation with him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 And <span class="bold">there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak</span> which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.11) <span class="bold">“There came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 <span class="bold">And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.12) “And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (6.14-16) And then God joins in the conversation with Gideon and the angel, promising to help Gideon kill all the Midianites.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 And <span class="bold">the LORD</span> looked upon him, and <span class="bold">said</span>, Go in this thy might, and <span class="bold">thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.14) <span class="bold">“The LORD … said … thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee?”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 <span class="bold">And he said</span> unto him, Oh my Lord, <span class="bold">wherewith shall I save Israel?</span> behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.15) <span class="bold">“And he said … wherewith shall I save Israel?”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 And <span class="bold">the LORD said</span> unto him, Surely <span class="bold">I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.16) “The LORD said … I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">17 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (6.17) <span class="bold">“Shew me a sign.”</span> So Gideon has a three-way conversation with the angel and God, but he doesn’t believe either of them. He demands a sign.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">18 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (6.20-21) To prove he’s for real, the angel makes fire come out of a rock, burning flesh and cakes.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 And <span class="bold">the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth.</span> And he did so.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.20) <span class="bold">“The angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">21 Then <span class="bold">the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff</span> that was in his hand, <span class="bold">and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes.</span> Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.21) <span class="bold">“The angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff … and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">22 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O Lord GOD! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovah-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00027.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (6.25-28a) God tells Gideon to vandalize his neighbors’ places of worship.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">25 And it came to pass the same night, that <span class="bold">the LORD said unto him,</span> Take thy father’s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and <span class="bold">throw down the altar of Baal</span> that thy father hath, <span class="bold">and cut down the grove</span> that is by it:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.25) <span class="bold">“The LORD said unto him … throw down the altar of Baal … and cut down the grove.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">26 And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father’s household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.28a) <span class="bold">“The altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00025.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (6.28b) <span class="bold">“The second bullock was offered upon the altar.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">29 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">34 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (6.34) <span class="bold">“The Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">35 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text" id="jud6-36"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (6.36-40) Then after sacrificing some animals for God, vandalizing his neighbors’ places of worship, and blowing a trumpet, Gideon asks for some (more) signs to convince him that God isn’t lying to him. (The burning flesh sign in 6.20-21 didn’t satisfy him.) So he puts down some wool on the ground and asks God to make it wet, while keeping the surrounding ground dry. And God does it, no sweat. But Gideon is still not sure he can trust God, so he asks him to reverse the trick, and make the ground wet and the wool dry. “And God did so.” Gideon must have been impressed by a God that could do such great things.<br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con148">148 Is it OK to test (or tempt) God?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">36 And <span class="bold">Gideon said unto God</span>, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jud6-37">37 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.36-37) <span class="bold">“Gideon said unto God … I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">38 <span class="bold">And it was so</span>: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.38) <span class="bold">“And it was so.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">39 And <span class="bold">Gideon said unto God</span>, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; <span class="bold">let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.39) <span class="bold">“Gideon said unto God … let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">40 <span class="bold">And God did so</span> that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.40) <span class="bold">“And God did so.”</span></p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_218">JUDGES 7</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="jud7-1"><span class="drop-cap">7</span> Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And <span class="bold">the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many</span> for me to give the Midianites into their hands, <span class="bold">lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (7.2a) After God passed all of Gideon’s tests, Gideon and God get down to business. First they need an army. Luckily, the Israelite slaves maintained a large, well-equiped army. But the army was too big for God’s liking. He worried that if they killed all the Midianites with a big army, no one would believe that it was God that did the killing. And God wants all the credit for his killings.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(7.2b) <span class="bold">“The LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many … lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, <span class="bold">Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him</span> return and <span class="bold">depart</span> early from mount Gilead. <span class="bold">And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (7.3a) So God told Gideon to get rid of some of the men. Start with the chicken shits.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(7.3b) <span class="bold">“Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him … depart … And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (7.4-5) And that got rid of 22,000. But 10,000 were still there, which was still too many. But God had a plan.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">God told Gideon to have the soldiers go down to the water to get a drink. Those that lap water “as a dog lappeth” are the natural-born killers that he’s looking for, while those that get down on their knees to use a cup or their hands should be sent home to mama.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jud7-4">4 And <span class="bold">the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water</span>, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(7.4) <span class="bold">“The LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 <span class="bold">So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself</span>; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(7.5) <span class="bold">“So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (7.6-7) So Gideon brought them all down to the water to get a drink. Out of the 10,000 non-chicken shits, only 300 lapped water like a dog. These were the few good men that God was looking for. Because God knows that real men pee standing up and lap water like dogs.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 <span class="bold">And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men</span>: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(7.6) <span class="bold">“And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 And <span class="bold">the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you</span>, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(7.7) <span class="bold">“The LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And it came to pass the same night, that <span class="bold">the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(7.9) <span class="bold">“The LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (7.12a) The Midianites and Amalekites had an infinite number of camels—well, maybe not quite, but at least as many “as the sand by the sea shore.” Which is strange since God killed every male Midianite during the time of Moses, and yet here, 250 or so years later, they flourish like grasshoppers “without number.”</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(7.12b) <span class="bold">“The Midianites and the Amalekites</span> [were] <span class="bold">like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (7.13-14) Was Gideon worried about attacking a gazillion Midianites with an army of 300 water lappers?</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">No, because some guy had a dream about barley cakes and tents. The barley cake smote the tent and—well, anyway, it was a sign from God that he and Gideon would massacre the Midianites.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 And when Gideon was come, behold, <span class="bold">there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell,</span> and overturned it, that the tent lay along.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(7.13) <span class="bold">“There was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 <span class="bold">And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon</span> the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for <span class="bold">into his hand hath God delivered Midian</span>, and all the host.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (12.1a) After Jephthah finished burning his daughter for God to pay God back for helping him slaughter twenty Ammonite cities, he ran into some Ephraimites who were angry about being left out of the Ammonite slaughter. They were so pissed off about the whole thing that they threatened to burn down Jephthah’s house.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(12.1b) <span class="bold">“The men of Ephraim … said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (12.2-4) Jephthah claimed that he invited them to join him in the God-assisted slaughter, but they didn’t come. Clearly, there was only one thing for Jephthah to do: call for a holy civil war. So that’s what he did, and the men from Gilead defeated the Epharimites.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 And <span class="bold">Jephthah said</span> unto them, <span class="bold">I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(12.2) <span class="bold">“Jephthah said … I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, <span class="bold">and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(12.3) <span class="bold">“And the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 <span class="bold">Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim</span>, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(12.4) <span class="bold">“Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim.”</span></p>

When an Ephraimite came to the crossing, the Gileadites would ask him if he was an Ephraimite. If he said, “No”, they’d ask him to say “Shibboleth” (Ephraimites couldn’t pronounce it correctly. It was like asking George W. Bush or Sarah Palin to say “nuclear.”) Then when the lying Ephraimite mispronounced Shibboleth by saying Siboleth, they’d kill him.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">And the shibboleth test worked like a charm. 42,000 Ephraimites failed the test and were killed trying to cross the Jordan.<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jud12-5">5 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that <span class="bold">when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite?

  <p class="Notes-Text">(12.5) <span class="bold">“When those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jud12-6">6 <span class="bold">Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him</span> at the passages of Jordan: <span class="bold">and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(12.6) <span class="bold">“Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him … and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.”</span></p>

  It starts out in the usual way, with the children of Israel doing evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord doing what he always does in such cases: he sells them. (Except that in this case he “delivered” them to the Philistines for forty years, so maybe the Israelites were a gift and he didn’t get paid for them.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 And after him <span class="bold">Abdon</span> the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And he <span class="bold">had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts</span>: and he judged Israel eight years.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And <span class="bold">the angel of the LORD appeared</span> unto the woman, <span class="bold">and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (13.3a) After giving, selling, or renting the Israelites to the Philistines, God needed to find someone to help kill the Israelites’ new owners. And that’s where Sampson comes in.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">Sampson’s birth was a lot like Jesus’. An angel visited his mom to announce that she was going to have a son.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(13.3b) <span class="bold">“The angel of the LORD appeared … and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.”</span> Manoah’s nameless wife, like so many biblical women, is barren. But an angel (or “a man of God”) fixes that, and Samson is born.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jud13-4">4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and <span class="bold">drink not wine nor strong drink</span>, and eat not any unclean thing:</p>

But Samson was a mass murderer. He must have touched hundreds of dead bodies. (Or did he just kill his victims, being careful not to touch them after they were dead?)</p>

She didn’t ask him where he came from and he refused to tell her his name.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, <span class="bold">A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and <span class="bold">the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(13.9) <span class="bold">“The angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 And <span class="bold">the woman</span> made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and <span class="bold">said</span> unto him, Behold, <span class="bold">the man</span> hath appeared unto me, that <span class="bold">came unto me the other day.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, <span class="bold">Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (13.18) <span class="bold">“Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret?”</span> The impregnating angel had a secret name. (Clarence?, 007?, agent 99?)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 So <span class="bold">Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD</span>: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">21 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jud13-22">22 And Manoah said unto his wife, <span class="bold">We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="jud14-1"><span class="drop-cap1">14</span> And <span class="bold">Samson</span> went down to Timnath, and <span class="bold">saw a woman</span> in Timnath <span class="bold">of the daughters of the Philistines.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.1) <span class="bold">“Samson … saw a woman … of the daughters of the Philistines.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? <span class="bold">And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.3) <span class="bold">“And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 <span class="bold">But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines</span>: for at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (14.4a) Now Samson’s parents were a bit troubled by this, since they knew how crazy God gets when an Israelite even thinks about marrying a non-Israelite. But they didn’t know that Samson’s lust for the Philistine woman was “of the Lord.” It was all a part of God’s plan for killing Philistines.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.4b) <span class="bold">“But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00025.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (14.5-6) Samson was on his way to visit his new Philistine girlfriend when “the Spirit of the Lord came mightily” upon him, and he ripped up a young lion.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, <span class="bold">behold, a young lion roared against him.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.5) <span class="bold">“Behold, a young lion roared against him.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 <span class="bold">And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid</span>, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.</p>

On his way he saw the lion carcass, which was covered with bees and filled with honey (a meaningless miracle—or just rotting flesh and maggots?) and Samson ate some of it. He liked it so much that he took a few handfuls home to feed to his parents. (He didn’t tell them where it came from.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and <span class="bold">she pleased Samson well.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.7) <span class="bold">“She pleased Samson well.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 And after a time he returned to take her, and <span class="bold">he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.8) <span class="bold">“He turned aside to see the carcase of the lion: And, Behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 <span class="bold">And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.9) <span class="bold">“And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (14.10-14) The Bible doesn’t actually say so, but I guess Samson married he Philistine woman that pleased him well. Then he had a week-long party with thirty of his new-found Philistine friends.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">At the party, Samson told a riddle. Whoever can figure it out before the week of partying is over will get 30 sheets and 30 garments. But whoever can’t will have to give Samuel 30 sheets and 30 garments. Here’s the riddle: “Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 So his father went down unto the woman: and <span class="bold">Samson made there a feast</span>; for so used the young men to do.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.10) <span class="bold">“Samson made there a feast.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that <span class="bold">they brought thirty companions to be with him.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.11) <span class="bold">“They brought thirty companions to be with him.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 <span class="bold">And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast</span>, and find it out, then <span class="bold">I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments</span>:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.12) <span class="bold">“And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast … I will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 <span class="bold">But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments.</span> And they said unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.13) <span class="bold">“But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 <span class="bold">And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness</span>. And they could not in three days expound the riddle.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.14) <span class="bold">“And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (14.15-17) Samson’s party buddies took the riddle seriously. They tell Samson’s new Philistine wife to tell them the answer to the riddle or they’ll burn her house down. After crying in front of Samson for seven days, she finally got the answer from Samson, and she told the guys at the party.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson’s wife, <span class="bold">Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire</span>: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.15) <span class="bold">“Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 And Samson’s wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And <span class="bold">she wept before him the seven days</span>, while their feast lasted: <span class="bold">and</span> it came to pass <span class="bold">on the seventh day</span>, that <span class="bold">he told her</span>, because she lay sore upon him: <span class="bold">and she told the riddle to</span> the children of <span class="bold">her people</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(14.17) <span class="bold">“She wept before him the seven days … and … on the seventh day … he told her … and she told the riddle to … her people.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">18 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? And <span class="bold">he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.</span></p>

He wanted his wife back, because, as you’ll recall, “she pleased Samson well.” So Samson had an idea, an idea that only one of God’s special heroes could come up with. He’d catch 300 foxes, tie their tails together, light them on fire, and set them loose in the Philistine’s grain fields.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jud15-4">4 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 And <span class="bold">when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines</span>, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (15.6) But it didn’t work out as planned. After the burning foxes destroyed the fields, the Philistines didn’t give Samson his wife back; they burned her and her father to death.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 And it came to pass, <span class="bold">when she pressed him daily</span> with her words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (20.8-9) When the Israelites heard this, they all said together in complete unison.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(20.9) “This shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it.” (God’s just war theory: Since the town of Gibeah was where the incident with the concubine occurred, and the inhabitants of Gibeah were from the tribe of Benjamin, the other Israelite tribes must go to war with the Benjamites. This may not make much sense to you, but it does to God.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.</p>

God said the tribe of Judah should go first. Judah goes to war and the Benjamites, with their 700 sharp shooting lefties, kill 22,000 Israelites.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 And <span class="bold">the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">26 <span class="bold">Then all the children of Israel,</span> and all the people, went up, and <span class="bold">came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD</span>, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">29 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baal-tamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">36 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">37 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; <span class="bold">and the liers in wait</span> drew themselves along, and <span class="bold">smote all the city with the edge of the sword.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">38 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">39 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">40 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">41 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">42 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">43 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.</p>
