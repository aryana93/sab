  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.</i> — <span class="small">Psalm 137.9</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">The thing that stands out about the psalms is how violent, vengeful, and vindictive they are. “Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth … let them be cut pieces.” Such prayers fill the psalms along with statements like this: “The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.”</p>

Therefore God hates homosexuals— or fags, as Rev. Phelps indelicately puts it.<br class="calibre9" />
