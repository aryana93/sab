  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes.</i> — <span class="small">Genesis 19.8</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Genesis has it all: sex, violence, contradictions, insults to women, absurdities, conflicts with science and history, you name it. Well, except for anything good, that is. God declared his creation to be “very good” in 1.31, but I can’t find anything good in Genesis.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1">GENESIS 1</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="gen1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> <i class="italic"><span class="bold">In the beginning</span> God created the heaven and the earth.</i></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-2">2 <i class="italic">And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</i></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.1) <span class="bold">“In the beginning”</span> The first of two contradictory creation accounts. Compare with 2.4-25 in which the order of events is entirely different.<br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con1">1 The two creations</a><br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con2">2 Who created heaven and earth?</a></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">The Genesis 1 account conflicts with the order of events that are known to science. In 1.1, the earth and “heaven” are created together “in the beginning,” whereas according to current estimates, the earth and universe are 4.6 and 13.7 billion years old, respectively. In Genesis, the earth is created (1.1) before sun and stars (1.16); birds and whales (1.21) before reptiles and insects (1.24); and flowering plants (1.11) before animals (1.20). The order of events known from science is in each case just the opposite.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen1-3">3 And God said, <span class="bold">Let there be light</span>: and there was light.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.3) <span class="bold">“Let there be light.”</span>God creates light and separates light from darkness, and day from night, on the first day (1.3-5). Yet he didn’t make the light producing objects (the sun and the stars) until the fourth day (1.14-19). And how could there be “evening and the morning” on the first day if there was no sun to mark them?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen1-4">4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-5">5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-6">6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-7">7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-8">8 And <span class="bold">God called the firmament Heaven</span>. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.8) <span class="bold">“God called the firmament Heaven.”</span> God spends one-sixth of his entire creative effort (the second day) working on a solid firmament. This strange structure, which God calls heaven, is intended to separate the higher waters from the lower waters.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen1-9">9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-10">10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-11">11 And God said, <span class="bold">Let the earth bring forth grass</span>, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.11) <span class="bold">“Let the earth bring forth grass.”</span> Plants are made on the third day before there was a sun to drive their photosynthetic processes (1.14-19). Notice, though, that God lets “the earth bring forth” the plants, rather than creating them directly. Maybe Genesis is not so anti-evolution after all.<br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con3">3 Were plants created before or after humans?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen1-12">12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-13">13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-14">14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and <span class="bold">let them be for signs</span>, and for seasons, and for days, and years:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.14) <span class="bold">“Let them be for signs.”</span> God placed the sun, moon, and stars in the firmament so that they can be used “for signs.” This, of course, is exactly what astrologers do: read “the signs” in the Zodiac to predict what will happen on Earth.<br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con4">4 Does the bible condemn astrology?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen1-15">15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-16">16 And <span class="bold">God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.16a) <span class="bold">“God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.”</span> But the moon is not a light; it only reflects light from the sun. And why, if God made the moon to “rule the night,” does it spend half of its time moving through the daytime sky?</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.16b) <span class="bold">“He made the stars also.”</span> God spends a day making light (before making the sun and stars) and separating light from darkness; then, at the end of a hard day’s work, and almost as an afterthought, he makes the billions of trillions of stars.<br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con5">5 When were the stars made?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen1-17">17 And <span class="bold">God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth</span>,</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.17) <span class="bold">“God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.”</span> Then why is only a tiny fraction of stars visible from earth? Under the best conditions, no more than a few thousand stars are visible with the unaided eye, yet there are hundreds of billions of stars in our galaxy and a hundred billion or so galaxies. Were they all created “to give light upon the earth”?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen1-18">18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-19">19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-20">20 And God said, <span class="bold">Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl</span> that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.20, 24) <span class="bold">“Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl … Let the earth bring forth the living creature.”</span> Does the Bible teach evolution?<br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con6">6 From what were the animals created?</a><br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con7">7 From what were the fowls created?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen1-21">21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-22">22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-23">23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-24">24 And God said, <span class="bold">Let the earth bring forth the living creature</span> after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen1-25">25 And <span class="bold">God made the beast of the earth</span> after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.25) <span class="bold">“God made the beast of the earth.”</span><br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con8">8 Were humans created before the other animals?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen1-26">26 And God said, <span class="bold">Let us make man in our image</span>, after our likeness: and <span class="bold">let them have dominion</span> over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and <span class="bold">over all the earth</span>, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.26a) <span class="bold">“Let us make man in our image.”</span><br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con9">9 How many gods are there?</a></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.26b) <span class="bold">“Let them have dominion … over all the earth”</span> God gave humans dominion over every other living thing on earth. This couldn’t be true, of course, since millions of other species existed for millions of years before humans existed. This verse is used by fundamentalist Christians to justify the mistreatment of other species and disregard for the environment.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen1-27">27 <span class="bold">So God created man in his own image</span>, in the image of God created he him; <span class="bold">male and female created he them.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.27) <span class="bold">“So God created man in his own image … male and female created he them.”</span> This verse implies that God is both male and female and that men and women are of equal value.<br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con10">10 When was Eve created?</a></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.28) <span class="bold">“Be fruitful and multiply.”</span><br class="calibre9" />

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen1-29">29 And God said, Behold, <span class="bold">I have given you every herb</span> bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, <span class="bold">and every tree</span>, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you <span class="bold">it shall be for meat.</span></p>

What about <span class="italic">Canabis sativa</span>? Is it okay to eat (or smoke) that plant? How about the opium poppy, coca plant, or the peyote cactus?</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">Since many plants have evolved poisons to protect against animals that would like to eat them, God’s advice here is more than a little reckless. Would you tell your children to go out in the garden and eat whatever plants they encounter?<br class="calibre9" />

Adam ate from the tree of knowledge and yet he didn’t die. In fact he lived for another 930 years or so (5.5).] But Adam never got a chance to eat from the tree of life.

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.6) <span class="bold">“And he did eat.”</span> In 2.17 God said that if Adam eats from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, then the day that he does so, he will die. But Adam eats the forbidden fruit and yet lives for another 930 years (5.5).</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (3.17) <span class="bold">“Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife”</span> Adam is also punished, although less severely.

Foxgloves, oleander, and milkweeds were perfectly safe to eat.</p>

Why doesn’t Genesis get its story straight? Because there were two separate accounts that were (somewhat clumsily) interwoven.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen8-9">9 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.</p>

He makes a deal with the animals, promising never to drown them all again. He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever he sees it, it will remind him of his promise so that he won’t be tempted to do it again. (Every time God sees the rainbow he says to himself: “Oh, yeah…. That’s right. I promised not to drown the animals again. I guess I’ll have to find something else to do.”). But rainbows are caused by the nature of light, the refractive index of water, and the shape of raindrops. There were rainbows hundreds of millions of years before humans existed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen9-14">14 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:</p>

His son, Ham, happens to see his father in this condition. When Noah sobers up and hears “what his young son had done unto him” (what did he do besides look at him?), he curses not Ham, who “saw the nakedness of his father,” but Ham’s son, Canaan. “A servant of servants shall he [Canaan] be unto his brethren.” This is a typical case of biblical justice, and is one of many Bible passages that has been used to justify slavery.<br class="calibre9" />

[Which is odd, since later (22.2-10) Abraham doesn’t even question God’s request that he kill his own son.] He asks God two good questions: “Wilt thou destroy the righteous with the wicked?” and “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” (The answers are “yes” and “no”, respectively.)</p>

Too bad Abraham didn’t ask God about the children. Why not save them? If Abraham could find 10 good children, toddlers, infants, or babies, would God spare the city? Apparently not.

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen29-20">20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen29-21">21 And Jacob said unto Laban, <span class="bold">Give me my wife</span>, for my days are fulfilled, <span class="bold">that I may go in unto her.</span></p>

Jacob asks for Rachel so that he can “go in unto her.” But Laban gives him Leah instead, and Jacob “went in unto her [Leah]” by mistake. Jacob was fooled until morning—apparently he didn’t know who he was going in unto. Finally they worked things out and (after working another seven years) Jacob got to “go in unto” Rachel, too.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen29-22">22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen29-23">23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen29-24">24 And <span class="bold">Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen29-25">25 <span class="bold">And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah</span>: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?</p>

(Hey, it happens—a lot in Genesis! See 19.33, 19.35, 38.16)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen29-26">26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen29-27">27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen29-28">28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and <span class="bold">he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen29-29">29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen29-30">30 And <span class="bold">he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved</span> also <span class="bold">Rachel more than Leah</span>, and served with him yet seven other years.</p>

He loved Rachel more than Leah.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen29-31">31 And <span class="bold">when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:</span> but Rachel was barren.</p>

(Like he did to Sarah and Rebekah.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen29-32">32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen29-33">33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, <span class="bold">Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated</span>, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.</p>

And it’s a good thing, too, since Jacob hated her until then.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen29-34">34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen29-35">35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(30.1) <span class="bold">“When Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children or else I die.”</span> Rachel considers herself worthless if she cannot produce children for her husband.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(30.3) <span class="bold">“Behold my maid Bilhah, Go in unto her.”</span> But luckily she has an idea. She says to Jacob, “Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her.” She solved the problem the same way Sarah did in 16.2.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen30-4">4 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: <span class="bold">and Jacob went in unto her.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen30-5">5 <span class="bold">And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(30.14) <span class="bold">“Reuben … found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.”</span> (Mandrakes are narcotic plants in the Solanaceae family, with many associated superstitious beliefs. Their bulbous roots sometimes resemble male sexual organs and were thought to be aphrodisiacs. Unfortunately, they only grow where the semen of a hanged man falls to the ground, so they are rare nowadays. If you find one, don’t dig up the root; if you do, you will be instantly killed by its scream.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen30-15">15 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And <span class="bold">Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son’s mandrakes.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(30.15) <span class="bold">“Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son’s mandrakes.”</span> Rachel trades sex with her husband for Leah’s mandrakes.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen30-16">16 <span class="bold">And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen30-37">37 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gen30-38">38 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.</p>

The result is streaked, speckled, and spotted baby goats. (Goats are “cattle” in the King James Version.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="gen30-40">40 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban’s cattle.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="gen33-1"><span class="drop-cap1">33</span> And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (33.10) <span class="bold">“I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God.”</span> Since Jacob just saw the face of God a few verses ago (32.30), he ought to know what God looks like. So now we do too. God looks just like Esau! Which is kind of strange, since God hates Esau (Mal 1.3, Rom 9.13).</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">So all those pictures of God that you’ve seen? They had it all wrong. God is a redhead, just like Esau was. In fact, God is covered with red hair all over his body. And every time God looks in the mirror, he says to himself, “Damn, I look just like Esau. And I hate Esau.” Unless, of course, Jacob was a liar. (Which he was. That’s why God likes him so much. See 27.19)</p>

    There is one voice that is entirely missing from this story: Dinah’s. Did she love Shechem? Did she want to marry him? Or did she want him killed? Was this a Romeo/Juliet-type story, with two young lovers willing to overlook their cultural and religious differences in order to be together?
