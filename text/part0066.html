  <p class="noindent">Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things. — <span class="small">Titus 2.9</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Although Titus claims to have been written by Paul, most scholars believe that it, along with the other Pastoral Epistles (1 and 2 Timothy), was written by someone else long after Paul’s death.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">There’s not much of interest here. But we do learn about liars (God can’t tell a lie, Jews and Cretans can’t tell the truth), Jewish fables and genealogies (disregard them), wives and slaves (must be obedient), and heretics (are condemned by God and should be avoided)</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are the highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">God, like George Washington (but unlike the author of Titus who falsely claims to be Paul), cannot tell a lie. <a href="part0066.html#titu1-2">1.2</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Jews are unruly liars “whose mouths must be stopped.” <a href="part0066.html#titu1-10">1.10-11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">The people of Crete are “always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.” <a href="part0066.html#titu1-12">1.12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Disregard “Jewish fables and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.” Like most of the Bible, maybe? <a href="part0066.html#titu1-14">1.14</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Teach the young women to be … obedient to their own husbands.” <a href="part0066.html#titu2-4">2.4-5</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Slaves must obey their masters and “please them well in all things … showing all good fidelity.” <a href="part0066.html#titu2-9">2.9-10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Avoid foolish … genealogies.” Like Gen <a href="part0010_split_000.html#gen10-1">10</a>, <a href="part0022.html#chron1-1">1 Chr 1-9</a>, and <a href="part0052_split_000.html#luke3-1">Lk 3</a>? <a href="part0066.html#titu3-9">3.9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Heretics are to be rejected since they are subverted sinners who are condemned by God. <a href="part0066.html#titu3-10">3.10-11</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.1-4) <span class="bold">“Paul … to Titus”</span> Although this epistle claims to have been written by Paul, most scholars believe that it was written pseudonymously after his death.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="titu1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> <span class="bold">Paul</span>, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="titu1-2">2 In hope of eternal life, which <span class="bold">God, that cannot lie</span>, promised before the world began;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.2) <span class="bold">“God, that cannot lie”</span> God, like George Washington (but unlike the author of Titus who falsely claims to be Paul), cannot tell a lie.<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 <span class="bold">To Titus</span>, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="titu1-6">6 If any be blameless, <span class="bold">the husband of one wife</span>, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00024.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.6) “The husband of one wife” A bishop should have only one wife. I guess it’s OK for laymen to have several.<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="titu1-7">7 For <span class="bold">a bishop must be</span> blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, <span class="bold">just</span>, holy, temperate;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="titu1-10">10 For <span class="bold">there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 <span class="bold">Whose mouths must be stopped</span>, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00027.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.10-11) “There are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision: Whose mouths must be stopped.” Jews are unruly liars “whose mouths must be stopped.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="titu1-12">12 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, <span class="bold">The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00029.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.12) <span class="bold">“The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="titu1-14">14 <span class="bold">Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments</span> of men, that turn from the truth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1126">TITUS 2</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="titu2-1"><span class="drop-cap">2</span> But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="titu2-4">4 That they may <span class="bold">teach the young women to be</span> sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, <span class="bold">obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.4-5) “Teach the young women to be … obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 <span class="bold">Young men</span> likewise exhort to <span class="bold">be sober minded.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00028.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.6) “Young men … be sober minded.” I suppose it’s good for young men to be “sober minded.” But is it OK to have some fun now and then?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 <span class="bold">In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works</span>: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, <span class="bold">sincerity</span>,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00028.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (3.1-2) Do good works; be gentle toward others; avoid fighting or speaking unkindly about others.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.2) “To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="titu3-5">5 <span class="bold">Not by works</span> of righteousness which we have done, <span class="bold">but</span> according to his mercy he saved us, <span class="bold">by the washing</span> of regeneration, and renewing <span class="bold">of the Holy Ghost</span>;</p>
