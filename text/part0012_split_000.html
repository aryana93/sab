    <span class="bold">God’s instructions for animal sacrifices</span><br class="calibre9" />
    God gives detailed instructions for performing ritualistic animal sacrifices. Such bloody rituals must be important to God, judging from the number of times that he repeats their instructions. Indeed the entire first nine chapters of Leviticus can be summarized as follows: Get an animal, kill it, sprinkle the blood around, cut the dead animal into pieces, and burn it for a “sweet savor unto the Lord.”<br class="calibre9" />

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven days:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">38 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;</p>
