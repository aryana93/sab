  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</i> — <span class="small">Jonah 1.17</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Everyone knows about God’s whale of a fish tale. So there’s nothing much I need to say about that.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">There’s not much else of interest in Jonah, except maybe that:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">

    <li class="calibre8">God made “a great fish” swallow Jonah, who stayed in the fish’s belly for three days and three nights. <a href="part0041.html#jona1-17">1.17</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“The LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.” <a href="part0041.html#jona2-10">2.10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">After hearing Jonah preach, everyone in Nineveh turned to God, including all the animals. Jonah must have been one hell of a preacher! <a href="part0041.html#jona3-5">3.5</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">All the animals in Ninevah put on sackcloth and cried “mightily unto God.” <a href="part0041.html#jona3-8">3.8</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God prepared a gourd to shade Jonah’s head, a worm to destroy the gourd, and then a drying wind and baking sun that made Jonah wish he was dead. <a href="part0041.html#jona4-6">4.6-8</a></li>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="jona1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.3, 10) Jonah fled “from the presence of the Lord.” (There are some places where God can’t find you.)<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jona1-3">3 But <span class="bold">Jonah rose up to flee</span> unto Tarshish <span class="bold">from the presence of the LORD</span>, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.3) <span class="bold">“Jonah rose up to flee … from the presence of the LORD.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jona1-4">4 But <span class="bold">the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest</span> in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.4) <span class="bold">“The LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jona1-7">7 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and <span class="bold">let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.7) <span class="bold">“Let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.”</span> The sailors cast lots to see who was causing the storm. And it worked, too (casting lots always does), since the lot fell on Jonah.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jona1-10">10 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For <span class="bold">the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.10) <span class="bold">“The men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD, because he had told them.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.12-15) Jonah believed that by throwing himself into the sea, the storm would die down. So that’s what he did, and it worked!</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jona1-12">12 And he said unto them, <span class="bold">Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.12) <span class="bold">“Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jona1-15">15 <span class="bold">So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jona1-17">17 Now <span class="bold">the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="jona2-1"><span class="drop-cap">2</span> Then <span class="bold">Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly</span>,</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.1) <span class="bold">“Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; <span class="bold">out of the belly of hell cried I</span>, and thou heardest my voice.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.2) <span class="bold">“Out of the belly of hell cried I.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jona2-3">3 For <span class="bold">thou hadst cast me into the deep</span>, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jona2-10">10 And <span class="bold">the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</span></p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_891">JONAH 3</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="jona3-1"><span class="drop-cap">3</span> And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now <span class="bold">Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days’ journey.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (3.3) <span class="bold">“Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days’ journey.”</span> That would make it about 60 miles in diameter—larger than Los Angeles!</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 And <span class="bold">Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (3.4) <span class="bold">“Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.”</span> Jonah prophesies that in forty days Nineveh shall be overthrown. But it didn’t happen because God repented (Jonah 3.10).</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jona3-5">5 So <span class="bold">the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (3.5) <span class="bold">“The people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.”</span> Everyone in Nineveh turned to God? Jonah must have been one hell of a preacher!</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jona3-8">8 But <span class="bold">let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God</span>: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (3.8) <span class="bold">“Let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God.”</span> Even the animals converted when they heard Jonah preach!</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jona3-10">10 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and <span class="bold">God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them</span>; and he did it not.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.10) <span class="bold">“God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them.”</span><br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con32">32 Does God repent?</a></p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_892">JONAH 4</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="jona4-1"><span class="drop-cap">4</span> But <span class="bold">it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (4.1) <span class="bold">“It displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.”</span> Jonah was angry when his preaching converted a city.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (4.6-8) God prepared a gourd to shade Jonah’s head, a worm to destroy the gourd, and then a drying wind and baking sun that made Jonah wish he was dead.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jona4-6">6 And the LORD <span class="bold">God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head</span>, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(4.6) <span class="bold">“God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 But <span class="bold">God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(4.7) <span class="bold">“God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that <span class="bold">God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die</span>, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(4.8) <span class="bold">“God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(4.9-11) God asks Jonah why he is angry about the gourd. What about the 120,000 people that God planned to kill (along with their animals)? Shouldn’t he be angry about that, too?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 And <span class="bold">God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(4.9) <span class="bold">“God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And <span class="bold">should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(4.11) <span class="bold">“Should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?”</span></p>
