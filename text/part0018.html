  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.</i> — <span class="small">1 Samuel 15.3</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2"><span class="bold">First Samuel for Skeptics</span></p>

  <p class="noindent3">There are a few Bible verses that everyone should know. One of these is 1 Samuel 15.3, where God orders Saul to kill every Amalekite “man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.” Saul failed to kill everyone and everything, so God gave Saul’s kingdom to David, who was always happy to kill anyone for God.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">But there are other great stories in 1 Samuel. Did you hear the one about how David bought his first wife with 200 Philistine foreskins? Or how God smote the Philistines with hemorrhoids in their secret parts? Or how he asked them to make him five golden hemorrhoids? There’s lots of other stuff like that that you just won’t find anywhere else.</p>

  <p class="noindent3"><span class="bold">Here are some of the highlights:</span></p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">God smites the Philistines with hemorrhoids in their secret parts. <a href="part0018.html#sam5-9">5.9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He asks the Philistines to make him five golden hemorrhoids. <a href="part0018.html#sam6-4">6.4-5</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He kills 50,070 men for looking into the ark of the Lord. <a href="part0018.html#sam6-19">6.19</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“I will make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes.” <a href="part0018.html#sam11-2">11.2</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">The spirit of the Lord comes upon Samuel so he hacks some oxen in pieces and sends the pieces to all the coasts of Israel. <a href="part0018.html#sam11-7">11.7</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God orders Saul to kill every Amalekite “man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.” <a href="part0018.html#sam15-3">15.3</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He repents of having made Saul king since Saul refused to carry out God’s commandments (i.e., Saul refused to commit complete genocide on the Amalekites.) <a href="part0018.html#sam15-11">15.11</a>, <a href="part0018.html#sam15-18">18</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Saul is haunted by “an evil spirit from the Lord.” <a href="part0018.html#sam16-14">16.14-16</a>, <a href="part0018.html#sam16-23">23</a>, <a href="part0018.html#sam18-10">18.10</a>, <a href="part0018.html#sam19-9">19.9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">David buys a wife with 200 Philistine foreskins (twice the asking price). <a href="part0018.html#sam18-25">18.25-27</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Killing those that “pisseth against the wall.” <a href="part0018.html#sam25-22">25.22</a>, <a href="part0018.html#sam25-34">25.34</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">David kills all the Amalekites again (see <a href="part0018.html#sam15-7">15.7-8</a> where Saul kills them all the first time). <a href="part0018.html#sam27-8">27.8-11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Saul has a witch bring back Samuel from the dead. <a href="part0018.html#sam28-8">28.8-15</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">After being completely killed off by Saul (<a href="part0018.html#sam15-7">15.7-8</a>) and then David (<a href="part0018.html#sam27-8">27.8-11</a>), the Amalekites invade again. <a href="part0018.html#sam30-1">30.1</a></li>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_236">1 SAMUEL 1</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="sam1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="sam1-2">2 And <span class="bold">he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah</span>, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00024.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.2) <span class="bold">“He</span> [Samuel’s father] <span class="bold">had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah.”</span><br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con16">16 Is polygamy OK?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but <span class="bold">the LORD had shut up her womb.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00024.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.5) <span class="bold">“The Lord had shut up her</span> [Hannah’s] <span class="bold">womb.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="sam1-11">11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and <span class="bold">there shall no razor come upon his head.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.11) <span class="bold">“There shall no razor come upon his head.”</span> Hannah vows to give her son to the Lord and, as a sign of his holiness, to never cut his hair.<br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con133">133 Is it OK for men to have long hair?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and <span class="bold">Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00023.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.19) <span class="bold">“Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the Lord remembered her.”</span> (He probably said something like, “Oh yeah, she’s the one whose womb I shut up.”)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_237">1 SAMUEL 2</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="sam2-1"><span class="drop-cap">2</span> And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 <span class="bold">The LORD killeth</span>, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00025.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.6) <span class="bold">“The Lord killeth”</span>—every chance he gets.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="sam2-8">8 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for <span class="bold">the pillars of the earth are the LORD’S, and he hath set the world upon them.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.8) <span class="bold">“The pillars of the earth are the LORD’s, and he hath set the world upon them.”</span><br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 <span class="bold">The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder upon them</span>: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And the priests’ custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And <span class="bold">the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived</span>, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00023.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.21) <span class="bold">“The Lord visited Hannah, so that she conceived.”</span> Did he get her pregnant in the usual way?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">22 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that <span class="bold">his sons</span> did unto all Israel; and how they <span class="bold">lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle</span> of the congregation.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00023.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00024.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.22) <span class="bold">“His sons … lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">23 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD’S people to transgress.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding <span class="bold">they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00025.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00024.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.25) <span class="bold">“They hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.”</span> Eli’s sons didn’t listen to their father Eli, because God had already decided to kill them (which he does in 1 Sam 4.11).</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">26 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 And there came <span class="bold">a man of God</span> unto Eli, and <span class="bold">said unto him, Thus saith the LORD</span>, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 Behold, the days come, that <span class="bold">I will cut off thine arm,</span> and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and <span class="bold">there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 And the man of thine, whom <span class="bold">I shall</span> not cut off from mine altar, shall be to <span class="bold">consume thine eyes, and</span> to <span class="bold">grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">34 And <span class="bold">this shall be a sign unto thee, that</span> shall come upon <span class="bold">thy two sons</span>, on <span class="bold">Hophni and Phinehas</span>; in one day they <span class="bold">shall die</span> both of them.</p>

(Just to remind him of the nasty things he plans to do to him and his descendants to punish him for what his sons did.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">35 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">36 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="sam3-1"><span class="drop-cap">3</span> And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 And the asses of Kish Saul’s father were lost. And Kish said to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up to the high place.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, <span class="bold">I am the seer</span>: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 <span class="bold">And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found.</span> And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father’s house?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">21 And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then speakest thou so to me?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And when they were come down from the high place into the city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on,) but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_245">1 SAMUEL 10</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="sam10-1"><span class="drop-cap1">10</span> Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not unto thee, and shew it thee;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David every one from the face of the earth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying, Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David’s enemies.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone Ezel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I shot at a mark.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">36 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">39 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD, to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.</p>

He refuses, saying that he doesn’t even know who David is. David responds by promising to kill everyone in Nabal’s household that pisses against the wall. But Abigail went to David and paid him off, so David decided not to kill all of Nabal and all of his wall pissers.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 And <span class="bold">there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great</span>, and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Now <span class="bold">the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail</span>: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(25.2-3) <span class="bold">“There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very great. … The name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his sheep.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be unto all that thou hast.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in Carmel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: <span class="bold">give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(25.8) <span class="bold">“Give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.”</span> David sends ten “young men” to tell Nabal to give David whatever he has.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 And when David’s young men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And Nabal answered David’s servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know not whence they be?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 So David’s young men turned their way, and went again, and came and told him all those sayings.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword. And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant with them, when we were in the fields:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is determined against our master, and against all his household: for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by the covert of the hill, and, behold, David and his men came down against her; and she met them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for good.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="sam25-22">22 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, <span class="bold">if I leave</span> of all that pertain to him by the morning light <span class="bold">any that pisseth against the wall.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(25.22) <span class="bold">“If I leave … any that pisseth against the wall.”</span> David vows to will kill Nabal and all his men (or as he put it, “any that pisseth against the wall”.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">23 And <span class="bold">when Abigail saw David, she</span> hasted, and lighted off the ass, and <span class="bold">fell</span> before David <span class="bold">on her face</span>, and bowed herself to the ground,</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (25.23) <span class="bold">“When Abigail saw David, she … fell … on her face.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">24 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself with mine own hand.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="sam25-34">34 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, <span class="bold">except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(25.34) <span class="bold">“Except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.”</span> If Abigail hadn’t come and paid him off, David would have killed Nabal and any of his people “that pisseth against the wall”.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">35 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him, and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">36 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">37 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="sam25-38">38 And it came to pass about ten days after, that <span class="bold">the LORD smote Nabal, that he died.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">39 And <span class="bold">when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD</span>, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. <span class="bold">And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">41 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">42 <span class="bold">And Abigail hasted</span>, and arose, and rode upon an ass, with five damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the messengers of David, <span class="bold">and became his wife</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">43 <span class="bold">David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of them his wives.</span></p>

He also, at the same time, took another wife (#3), Abinoam. In the meantime, Saul gave Michal (his daughter and David’s first wife that he bought with 200 Philistine foreskins) to another man.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">44 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_261">1 SAMUEL 26</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="sam26-1"><span class="drop-cap1">26</span> And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was come in very deed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second time.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the LORD’S anointed, and be guiltless?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into battle, and perish.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’S anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 So <span class="bold">David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s bolster</span>; and they gat them away<span class="bold">, and no man saw it</span>, nor knew it, neither awaked: <span class="bold">for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that criest to the king?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD’S anointed. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’S anointed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal’s wife.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 Moreover <span class="bold">the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me:</span> the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(28.19) <span class="bold">“The LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me.”</span> God sent a message to Saul (through a dead man brought back to life by a witch) that tomorrow God would make sure that the Philistines kill him and his sons along with the Israelite soldiers (to punish Saul for not killing all the Amalekites like God told him to in 1 Samuel 15.3).</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest on thy way.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread thereof:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_264">1 SAMUEL 29</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="sam29-1"><span class="drop-cap1">29</span> Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in Jezreel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward with Achish.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with the heads of these men?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, <span class="bold">Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands</span>?</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00025.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (29.5) <span class="bold">“Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.”</span> The Philistine leaders didn’t trust David, even though David had committed many genocides for them. They had heard about how the Israelite dancing girls used to sing about David’s killings, singing, “Saul has killed his thousands, and David his tens of thousands.” So they worried that David could not be trusted to kill his own people. But they were wrong about that. David was always willing to kill anyone at anytime for any reason whatsoever. That’s why God loved him so much.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text">6 Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And <span class="bold">David said unto Achish, But what have I done?</span> and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with thee unto this day, <span class="bold">that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00025.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (29.8) <span class="bold">“David said unto Achish, But what have I done … that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?”</span> David was disappointed. He wanted to go kill Israelites with the Philistines.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up early in the morning, and have light, depart.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_265">1 SAMUEL 30</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="sam30-1"><span class="drop-cap1">30</span> And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that <span class="bold">the Amalekites had invaded the south</span>, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (30.1) <span class="bold">“The Amalekites had invaded the south.”</span> The Amalekites are a tough tribe. Twice they were “utterly destroyed” first by Saul (1 Sam.15.7-8) and then by David (1 Sam.27.9-11). Yet here they are, just a few years later, fighting the Philistines.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they <span class="bold">slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away</span>, and went on their way.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (30.1-2) <span class="bold">“The Amalekites … slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away.”</span> Believers like to say that the Amalekites were so evil that God had to kill them all, even their women and children. Yet here the Amalekites behave far better than the Israelites by not killing their captives. (Compare these verses with God’s command to Saul in 1 Sam.15.3.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters, were taken captives.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And <span class="bold">David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him</span>, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (30.6) <span class="bold">“David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="sam30-7">7 And David said to <span class="bold">Abiathar</span> the priest, <span class="bold">Ahimelech’s son</span>, I pray thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind stayed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him drink water;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone I fell sick.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing, because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="sam30-17">17 And <span class="bold">David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men</span>, which rode upon camels, and fled.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(30.17) <span class="bold">“David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save four hundred young men.”</span> David spends the day killing more of those pesky Amalekites. He kills all of them except for 400 that escaped on camels. (See 1 Sam.15.7-8, 20 and 27.8-9 for the last two times that they were exterminated.)<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave before those other cattle, and said, This is David’s spoil.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David, and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came near to the people, he saluted them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us, we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and delivered the company that came against us into our hand.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;</p>
