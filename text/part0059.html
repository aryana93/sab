  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</i> — <span class="small">Ephesians 5.22</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Although Ephesians claims to have been written by Paul to the church in Ephesus (1.1), most scholars think it was written after his death by one of his followers to no one in particular. The writing style, vocabulary, and theological views differ from those of Paul’s undisputed letters (1 Thessalonians, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Romans, Philippians, and Philemon). But whoever the author was, the letter itself is pretty boring.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are the highlights, such as they are.</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">We are predestined by God to go to either heaven or hell. None of our thoughts, words, or actions can affect the final outcome. <a href="part0059.html#ephe1-4">1.4-5</a>, <a href="part0059.html#ephe1-11">11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God had his son murdered to keep himself from hurting others for things they didn’t do. <a href="part0059.html#ephe1-7">1.7</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine.” (Reject the Bible and all religious belief.) <a href="part0059.html#ephe4-14">4.14</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Christ … hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.” The bloody death of Jesus smelled good to God. <a href="part0059.html#ephe5-2">5.2</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">No “unclean person” or “idolater” will inherit the kingdom of God. The wrath of God is on them. Don’t associate with them. <a href="part0059.html#ephe5-5">5.5-7</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Wives must submit to their husbands “in every thing” as though they were gods. “For the husband is the head of the wife.” <a href="part0059.html#ephe5-22">5.22-24</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Slaves must obey their masters “as unto Christ.” <a href="part0059.html#ephe6-5">6.5</a></li>
