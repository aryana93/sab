  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">The coming of the Lord draweth nigh.</i> — <span class="small">James 5.8</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">James is one of my favorite books in the Bible. I don’t know, maybe it’s just the ex-Catholic in me, but James doesn’t contain much that is objectionable, and has some really good stuff. Evangelical Protestants, of course, don’t much like the book of James, though few will admit it as openly as did their hero, Martin Luther. He despised it, calling it an “epistle of straw” since it so clearly contradicted his perverted belief that salvation comes from faith alone, independent of one’s actions.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Verses seldom quoted by born-again Christians or Teabagging Republicans:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">“Be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath.” <a href="part0069.html#jam1-19">1.19</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Pure religion … is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.” <a href="part0069.html#jam1-27">1.27</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">The rich should not be treated better than the poor. <a href="part0069.html#jam2-2">2.2-4</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?” <a href="part0069.html#jam2-14">2.14</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Help others that are in need; don’t just wish them well. <a href="part0069.html#jam2-15">2.15-16</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Faith without works is dead.” <a href="part0069.html#jam2-17">2.17</a>, <a href="part0069.html#jam2-20">20</a>, <a href="part0069.html#jam2-26">26</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.” <a href="part0069.html#jam2-19">2.19</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“By works a man is justified, and not by faith only.” <a href="part0069.html#jam2-24">2.24</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.” <a href="part0069.html#jam5-1">5.1</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Notes-Text">Of course, James also has some silly stuff. For example:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">If you are merciless to others, God will be merciless to you. (Two wrongs make a right.) <a href="part0069.html#jam2-13">2.13</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">James says that, even in his day, all beasts, birds, serpents, and sea creatures had been tamed by humans. <a href="part0069.html#jam3-7">3.7</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">If your prayers are not answered, it’s your own damned fault. <a href="part0069.html#jam4-3">4.3</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Whoever is a friend of the world is an enemy of God. <a href="part0069.html#jam4-4">4.4</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“The coming of the Lord draweth nigh.” <a href="part0069.html#jam5-8">5.8</a></li>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jam1-13">13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for <span class="bold">God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man</span>:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</p>
