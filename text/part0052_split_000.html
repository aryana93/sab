  <p class="Bible-Text" id="luke1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast been instructed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="luke1-5">5 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named <span class="bold">Zacharias</span>, of the course of Abia: <span class="bold">and his wife</span> was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was <span class="bold">Elisabeth</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And they <span class="bold">were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.5-6) <span class="bold">“Zacharias … and his wife … Elisabeth … were both righteous before God walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</span>”<br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con35">35 Has there ever been a righteous person?</a><br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con430">430 Does righteousness come from following the Law?</a></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00023.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.7-15) Zacharias and Elizabeth were both getting old, too old to have kids. But Zach prayed, so an angel appeared to tell him that God would take care of things for him. God would somehow get Liz pregnant and she’d have a son named John, who would be filled with the Holy Ghost from the moment God, the angel, the Holy Ghost, or Zach (or maybe all of them working together) got his mom pregnant.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.7) <span class="bold">“They had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren.”</span> Oh God, another barren woman! It’s always the woman’s fault in the Bible.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.11) <span class="bold">“There appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 But <span class="bold">the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.13) <span class="bold">“The angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.”</span> Whoopie! Another miraculous birth! Did old Zach have sex with Elizabeth or did the angel take care of things for him?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="luke1-15">15 For <span class="bold">he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink</span>; and <span class="bold">he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.15a) <span class="bold">“He shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink.”</span><br class="calibre9" />

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.15b) <span class="bold">“He shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother’s womb.”</span> John the Baptist was “filled with the Holy Ghost” even as a fetus!<br class="calibre9" />

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="luke1-17">17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to <span class="bold">the wisdom of the just</span>; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.17) <span class="bold">“The wisdom of the just”</span><br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con33">33 Has the ever been a just person?</a></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00025.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.18-20) Zechariah asks the angel Gabriel how his wife could become pregnant, since she is “stricken with years.” Gabriel makes him “dumb” just for asking.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">18 And <span class="bold">Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.18) <span class="bold">“Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 And <span class="bold">the angel</span> answering <span class="bold">said</span> unto him, <span class="bold">I am Gabriel</span>, that stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="luke1-20">20 And, behold, <span class="bold">thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak</span>, until the day that these things shall be performed, <span class="bold">because thou believest not my words</span>, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.19-20) <span class="bold">“The angel … said … I am Gabriel … Thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak … because thou believest not my words.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.28-31) The angel Gabriel stopped by Nazareth to visit the Most Blessed Virgin Mary and say the rosary with her. OK, not really. He stopped by to tell her that the Holy Ghost would soon be getting her pregnant the way he did her aunt Elizabeth. During his visit he composed the first part of the “Hail Mary.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, <span class="bold">Hail,</span> thou that art <span class="bold">highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.28) <span class="bold">“Hail</span> [Mary]<span class="bold">, highly faoroured</span> [full of grace]<span class="bold">, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">29 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 And <span class="bold">the angel said</span> unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.30-31) “The angel said … thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="luke1-34">34 <span class="bold">Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.34) “Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?” Just a few verses earlier (1.17-20), Zacharias is struck dumb for doubting his wife’s angel-assisted pregnancy. Why wasn’t Mary punished for her disbelief?<br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con329">329 Was Joseph the father of Jesus?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">35 And <span class="bold">the angel</span> answered and <span class="bold">said</span> unto her, <span class="bold">The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00023.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.35) <span class="bold">“The angel … said … The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.”</span> Gabriel tells Mary that the Holy Ghost will come on her and she’ll be covered by the power of God, so “the holy thing” that she delivers will be the Son of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="luke1-37">37 For <span class="bold">with God nothing shall be impossible.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.37) <span class="bold">“With God nothing shall be impossible.”</span><br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con59">59 Can God do anything?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="luke1-41">41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.41a) <span class="bold">“When Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb.”</span> John the Baptist, while still a fetus, leaped for joy when he heard the voice of Mary.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.41b) <span class="bold">“Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost.”</span><br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con431">431 When was the Holy Ghost given?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, <span class="bold">Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.42) <span class="bold">“Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb</span> [Jesus].<span class="bold">”</span> When Elisabeth saw Mary, she completed the first half of the “Hail Mary” that the angel Gabriel started in verse 28.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">43 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">45 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="luke1-50">50 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.50) <span class="bold">“His mercy is on them that fear him.”</span><br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con132">132 Should we fear God?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">51 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">52 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent empty away.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">57 Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">60 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">61 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they marvelled all.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spake, and praised God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">65 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">66 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="luke1-67">67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">69 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">70 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">71 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">72 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">73 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">74 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">75 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">76 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">77 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">78 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">79 To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 <span class="bold">The Spirit of the Lord is upon me</span>, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (4.18) <span class="bold">“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me.”</span> These words were spoken by Isaiah and referred to Isaiah. They were not a prophecy about a future prophet, as Jesus claims here, where he supposedly read these verses in the synagogue while applying them to himself. (See Isaiah 61.1-2)</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">But the verses that Jesus read are not the same as those in Isaiah 61.1-2, which reads: “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn.”</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">Did Jesus add the part about the blind and bruised to the verses he read from Isaiah? Or were they added later?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.</p>
