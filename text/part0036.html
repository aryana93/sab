  <h3 class="chaph1" id="chap27">DANIEL</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">The king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces.</i> — <span class="small">Daniel 6.24</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Although the book of Daniel was supposedly written during the Babylonian Exile by an official of King Nebuchadnezzar, modern scholars date its writing to the second century BCE. The reasons for this include:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">It is listed in the Writings of the Jewish canon, rather than the Prophets. This indicates that Daniel was written after the collection of prophetic books had been closed (sometime after 300 BCE).</li>

    <li class="calibre8">Parts of the book (2.4-7.28) were written in Aramaic, which suggests a later date when Aramaic had become the common language.</li>

    <li class="calibre8">The author of Daniel used Persian and Greek words that would not have been known to residents of Babylon in the 6th century BCE.</li>

    <li class="calibre8">The book contains numerous historical inaccuracies when dealing with 6th century BCE Babylonian history. Such mistakes would not have been made by an important official of King Nebuchadnezzar.</li>

    <li class="calibre8">Daniel is the only book in the Old Testament in which angels are given names (such as Gabriel in 8.16 and 9.21 and Michael in 10.13, 10.21, and 12.1 ). Elsewhere in the Bible, names for angels only appear in the in the Apocrypha and the New Testament.</li>

    <li class="calibre8">The absence of Daniel’s name in the list of Israel’s great men in Ecclesiasticus.</li>

    <li class="calibre8">Nebuchadrezzar is spelled Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel, which is the way the king’s name was spelled, under Greek influence, at a later time.</li>

    <li class="calibre8">In 2.2 the king’s wise men are called “Chaldeans.” But at the time of Nebuchadrezzar, “Chaldean” would have referred to a nationality. It was only centuries later that this word came to mean sorcerer or astrologer.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="noindent3">Modern historians and bible scholars generally agree on the proper interpretation of the dreams in the book of Daniel. Fundamentalists, however, adamantly disagree with them and with each other. Since I am neither fundamentalist nor scholar, I will make no attempt to interpret Daniel’s bizarre dreams.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">Daniel Highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">Nebuchadnezzar decrees that anyone who says anything against the Hebrew god “shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall become a dunghill.” <a href="part0036.html#dan3-29">3.29</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Nebuchadnezzar eats grass, grows hair like eagle feathers, and has nails like bird claws. <a href="part0036.html#dan4-33">4.33</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">A detached hand writes upon a wall. <a href="part0036.html#dan5-5">5.5-6</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Nebuchadnezzar orders those who accused Daniel (including their wives and children) to be cast into the lions den. <a href="part0036.html#dan6-24">6.24</a></li>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="dan1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> <span class="bold">In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.1) <span class="bold">“In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.”</span> The third year of the reign of Jehoiakim would be 606 BCE, at which time Nebuchadnezzar was not yet king of Babylon. It was 597 BCE that Nebuchadnezzar invaded Jerusalem for the first time (without actually destroying it). By that time Jehohiakim was dead and his son, Jehoiachin, was ruling.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 And <span class="bold">the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand</span>, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.2) <span class="bold">“The Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his</span> [Nebuchadnezzar’s] <span class="bold">hand.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king’s seed, and of the princes;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king’s palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="dan1-8">8 But <span class="bold">Daniel</span> purposed in his heart that he <span class="bold">would not defile himself with</span> the portion of <span class="bold">the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank</span>: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.8) “Daniel … would not defile himself with … the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank.”<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 Now <span class="bold">God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.9) <span class="bold">“God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.11-16) Melzar was worried that he’d get in trouble with the king if Daniel and his companions ate only pulse and water. So Daniel proposed a test: try it and see how they looked compared to the meat eaters. After only ten days, the vegans were way “fairer and fatter.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 <span class="bold">Then said Daniel to Melzar</span>, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 <span class="bold">Prove thy servants</span>, I beseech thee, <span class="bold">ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.11-12) <span class="bold">“Then said Daniel to Melzar … Prove thy servants … ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 <span class="bold">Then let our countenances be looked upon</span> before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king’s meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.13) <span class="bold">“Then let our countenances be looked upon.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 <span class="bold">So he</span> consented to them in this matter, and <span class="bold">proved them ten days.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.14) <span class="bold">“So he … proved them ten days.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.15) <span class="bold">“At the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king’s meat.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 <span class="bold">Thus Melzar took away</span> the portion of <span class="bold">their meat, and the wine</span> that they should drink<span class="bold">; and gave them pulse.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.16) <span class="bold">“Thus Melzar took away … their meat, and the wine … and gave them pulse.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.17-20) The king found Daniel and his companions ten times wiser than “all the magicians and astrologers in the realm.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">17 <span class="bold">As for these four children, God gave them knowledge</span> and skill in all learning and wisdom: <span class="bold">and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.17) <span class="bold">“As for these four children, God gave them knowledge … and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">18 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then <span class="bold">the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.18) <span class="bold">“The prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 And <span class="bold">the king</span> communed with them; and among them all was <span class="bold">found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah</span>: therefore stood they before the king.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.19) <span class="bold">“The king … found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 And <span class="bold">in all matters of wisdom and understanding</span>, that <span class="bold">the king</span> enquired of them, he <span class="bold">found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.20) “In all matters of wisdom and understanding … the king … found them [Daniel and his friends] <span class="bold">ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers in his realm.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">21 And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_851">DANIEL 2</h4>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.1-26) Nebuchadnezzar has a disturbing dream. He commands his astrologers and magicians to interpret it for him, but none of them could do it. So he threatens to cut them to pieces. Then Daniel shows up and interprets the dream.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="dan2-1"><span class="drop-cap">2</span> And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar <span class="bold">Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.1) <span class="bold">“Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was troubled, and his sleep brake from him.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 Then <span class="bold">the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.2) <span class="bold">“The king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: <span class="bold">if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.5) “If ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 <span class="bold">But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour</span>: therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.6) “But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 <span class="bold">The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter:</span> therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.10) “The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king’s matter.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 For this cause <span class="bold">the king was angry</span> and very furious<span class="bold">, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.12) “The king was angry … and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 He answered and said to Arioch the king’s captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would shew the king the interpretation.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of <span class="bold">God</span> for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And he changeth the times and the seasons: he <span class="bold">removeth kings, and setteth up kings</span>: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.20-21) <span class="bold">“God … removeth kings, and setteth up kings.”</span> Monarchy is God’s preferred form of government. God chooses the kings and then removes them when he feels like it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">22 He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto us the king’s matter.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 Therefore <span class="bold">Daniel</span> went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he <span class="bold">went and said</span> thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: <span class="bold">bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.24) “Daniel … went and said … bring me in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the interpretation.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">25 Then <span class="bold">Arioch brought in Daniel before the king</span> in haste<span class="bold">, and said</span> thus unto him<span class="bold">, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.25) <span class="bold">“Arioch brought in Daniel before the king … and said … I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">26 <span class="bold">The king</span> answered and <span class="bold">said to Daniel</span>, whose name was Belteshazzar, <span class="bold">Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.26) <span class="bold">“The king … said to Daniel … Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">27 Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the king;</p>

  He saw a gold headed image with silver chest and arms, brass belly and thighs, and iron legs with feet part iron and part clay. A stone smashed the image, scattering the gold, silver, brass, and iron in the wind. The stone became a great mountain that filled the whole earth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">28 But there is a <span class="bold">God</span> in heaven that revealeth secrets, and <span class="bold">maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these;</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.28) <span class="bold">“God … maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are these.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">29 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.36-44) <span class="bold">Daniel’s interpretation</span><br class="calibre9"/>
  The image’s gold head is Nebuchadnezzar. He will be replaced by another kingdom (silver chest and arms), which will be replaced by a third kingdom (brass belly and thighs), and a fourth kingdom (iron legs). This last kingdom with be both strong and weak (feet of iron and clay). Then God will raise up one final kingdom, which will destroy the other kingdoms and last forever.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">36 <span class="bold">This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">47 <span class="bold">The king</span> answered unto Daniel, and <span class="bold">said</span>, Of a truth it is, that <span class="bold">your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings</span>, and a revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">48 Then <span class="bold">the king made Daniel</span> a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him <span class="bold">ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="dan3-1"><span class="drop-cap">3</span> Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</p>

Taking a cubit to be 46 cm and assuming the depth to also be six cubits, this would give a total volume of about 120 cubic meters (depending on the shape of the statue)—which is about half as much gold as is in the United States Bullion Depository in Fort Knox, Kentucky.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (3.2-7) Nebuchadnezzar invited all the officials in his kingdom to come to the dedication of the gold statue.

So they told Nebuchadnezzar about it, who commanded that they be thrown into a fiery furnace that was seven times as hot as usual. The furnace was so hot that it burned to death the executioners who threw them in the fire.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 Wherefore at that time <span class="bold">certain Chaldeans</span> came near, and <span class="bold">accused the Jews</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, do not ye serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 Then was <span class="bold">Nebuchadnezzar</span> full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spake, and <span class="bold">commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (3.24-27) Daniel’s three friends were cast into a fiery furnace, but were totally unaffected—not even a hair was singed.

  <p class="Bible-Text2">24 Then <span class="bold">Nebuchadnezzar</span> the king <span class="bold">was astonished, and</span> rose up in haste, and spake, and <span class="bold">said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire</span>?

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw <span class="bold">these men, upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</span></p>

A “holy watcher” came down from heaven and began screaming, saying that someone should chop down the tree. But he said the stump should be left and a band of iron and brass put around it. Then have the banded stump hang out with the beasts and the grass, change the stump’s heart from a man’s heart to a beast’s heart, and “let seven times pass over him.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; <span class="bold">I saw, and behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</span></p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_854">DANIEL 5</h4>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (5.1-2,11,18, 22) Apparently, the author of Daniel knew of only two Babylonian kings during the period of the exile: Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar, who he wrongly thought was the son of Nebuchadnezzar. But Nebuchadnezzar died in 562 BCE and was succeeded by his son, Awel-Marduk (referred to in the bible as “Evilmerodach” [2 Kg 25.27 and Jer 52.31]). In 560 BCE, Amel-Marduk was assassinated by his brother-in-law, Nergal-shar-usur. The next and last king of Babylon was Nabonidus who reigned from 556 to 539, when Babylon was conquered by Cyrus. It was Nabonidus, and not Belshazzar, who was the last of the Babylonian kings. Belshazzar was the son and viceroy of Nabonidus. But he was not a king, and was not the son (or any other relation) of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="dan5-1"><span class="drop-cap">5</span> <span class="bold">Belshazzar the king</span> made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(5.1) <span class="bold">“Belshazzar the king”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 <span class="bold">Belshazzar</span>, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which <span class="bold">his father Nebuchadnezzar</span> had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(5.2) <span class="bold">“Belshazzar … his father Nebuchadnezzar”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.</p>

  Belshazzar was partying with his princes, wives, and concubines when a detached hand starts writing on the wall. When the king sees it “the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against the other.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="dan5-5">5 <span class="bold">In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote</span> over against the candlestick <span class="bold">upon</span> the plaister of <span class="bold">the wall</span> of the king’s palace: <span class="bold">and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(5.5) <span class="bold">“In the same hour came forth fingers of a man’s hand, and wrote … upon … the wall … and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 <span class="bold">Then the king’s countenance was changed,</span> and his thoughts troubled him, <span class="bold">so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(5.6) <span class="bold">“Then the king’s countenance was changed … so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (5.8-28) Belshazzar asked his wise men to read and interpret the writing, but none of them could. So his wife tells him to ask Daniel to do it. And Daniel does, after insulting Belshazzar and his “father” Nebuchadnezzar. It’s a message from God (he’s the one who sent the hand down), saying that God hates Belshazzar and will soon take his kingdom away from him and give it to the Medes and Persians.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 Then came in <span class="bold">all the king’s wise men</span>: but they <span class="bold">could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and his lords, came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will shew the interpretation.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 <span class="bold">Then was Daniel brought in before the king</span>. And the king spake and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 <span class="bold">Then Daniel</span> answered and <span class="bold">said</span> before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet <span class="bold">I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(5.17) “Then Daniel … said … I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">18 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">31 And <span class="bold">Darius the Median took the kingdom</span>, being about threescore and two years old.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (5.31) “Darius the Median took the kingdom.” Darius the Median is a fictitious character whom the author perhaps confused with Darius I of Persia, who came to the throne in 521 BCE, 17 years after the fall of Babylon. The author of Daniel incorrectly makes him the successor of Belshazzar instead of Cyrus.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_855">DANIEL 6</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="dan6-1"><span class="drop-cap">6</span> It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (6.3-9) The king preferred Daniel above everyone else in his kingdom because Daniel was such a perfect (and modest) guy. The other administrators tried to find something wrong with him, but they couldn’t. So they came up with another plan: attack his religion. Have the king sign a decree saying that anyone who asked any god or man (other than the king) for anything in the next thirty days will be fed to the lions.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 Then this <span class="bold">Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him</span>; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(6.3) “Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 Then <span class="bold">the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel</span> concerning the kingdom<span class="bold">; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="dan11-1"><span class="drop-cap1">11</span> Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into his hand.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land: but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully: for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 And both these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many: yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by spoil, many days.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">34 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">35 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because it is yet for a time appointed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">36 And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">37 <span class="bold">Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (11.37) <span class="bold">“Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of omen, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above all.”</span> Some Christians think this refers to the antichrist (He’ll be a homosexual).</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">38 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">39 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">40 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">41 He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">42 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and the land of Egypt shall not escape.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">43 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">44 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly to make away many.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">45 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.</p>
