  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned.</i> — <span class="small">2 Thessalonians 2.11-12</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Although this epistle (1.1, 3.17) claims to have been written by Paul, many scholars think it was a later forgery. If Paul did write it, though, he completely changed his mind (since writing 1 Thessalonians) about the timing of Christ’s return. The day of the Lord is no longer at hand. In fact, it’s nowhere near. Many things must happen first: there will be a great “falling away,” a “man of sin” will be reveled, and Satan will show off his power by doing all kinds of signs and wonders. (<a href="part0063.html#thessa2-2">2.2-9</a>)</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Every skeptic should know one passage from Second Thessalonians: <a href="part0063.html#thessa2-11">2.11-12</a>. (“God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned.”)</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are the highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">“Jesus … in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God … who shall be punished with everlasting destruction.” <a href="part0063.html#thessa1-7">1.7-9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Be not soon shaken in mind … by letter as from us.” What letter is being referred to here? Is it 1 Thessalonians? If so, then should Christians not read it to avoid being “skaken in mind?” <a href="part0063.html#thessa2-2">2.2</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Jesus will “consume” the wicked “with the spirit of his mouth.” <a href="part0063.html#thessa2-8">2.8</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Satan, not God, is all-powerful. <a href="part0063.html#thessa2-9">2.9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: That they all might be damned.” <a href="part0063.html#thessa2-11">2.11-12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation.” (If you’re among the chosen, that is. If not, you’re going to hell.) <a href="part0063.html#thessa2-13">2.13</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Those who disagree with the views expressed in this epistle are to be shunned. <a href="part0063.html#thessa3-6">3.6</a>, 14</li>

    <li class="calibre8">Those who will not or cannot work should starve to death. <a href="part0063.html#thessa3-10">3.10</a></li>
