  <h3 class="chaph1" id="chap54">1 TIMOTHY</h3>

  <p class="noindent">Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. — <span class="small">1 Timothy 2.11-12</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">First Timothy is one of the post-Pauline Pastoral Epistles (the others are 2 Timothy and Titus). Though all three claim to have been written by Paul, they weren’t. They were written in the second century, long after Paul had died.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Still, First Timothy has important information for women, slaves, and dieters. Women are not allowed to have authority over men, must dress modestly and be silent in church (<a href="part0064.html#tim2-11">2.11-12</a>). They can’t teach, braid their hair, or wear expensive clothes or jewelry (<a href="part0064.html#tim2-9">2.9</a>). Every woman is inferior to every man in every way. But there is a bright side: they are saved in childbearing! (<a href="part0064.html#tim2-13">2.13-15</a>)</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Slaves must obey their masters; otherwise God is somehow blasphemed (<a href="part0064.html#tim6-1">6.1</a>).</p>

  <p class="noindent3">And for all you health freaks out there: Eat meat (<a href="part0064.html#tim4-1">4.1-4</a>), don’t exercise (<a href="part0064.html#tim4-8">4.8</a>), and stop drinking water. Drink wine instead. (<a href="part0064.html#tim5-23">5.23</a>)</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are the highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">Ignore “fables and endless genealogies.” (Like <a href="part0010_split_000.html#gen10-1">Gen 10</a>, <a href="part0022.html#chron1-1">1 Chr 1-9</a>, <a href="part0050_split_000.html#matt1-1">Mt 1</a>, and <a href="part0052_split_000.html#luke3-1">Lk 3</a>) <a href="part0064.html#tim1-4">1.4</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Homosexuals are lawless, disobedient, unholy, and profane. <a href="part0064.html#tim1-10">1.10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.” <a href="part0064.html#tim1-20">1.20</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Women are to dress modestly, “with shamefacedness”—“not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array.” <a href="part0064.html#tim2-9">2.9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.” <a href="part0064.html#tim2-11">2.11-12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Men are superior to women since Adam was made before, and sinned after, Eve. But even though women are inferior to men, they shouldn’t be discouraged because they shall “be saved in childbearing.” <a href="part0064.html#tim2-13">2.13-15</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“In the latter times some shall depart from the faith” by becoming vegetarians. <a href="part0064.html#tim4-1">4.1-4</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Bodily exercise profiteth little.” <a href="part0064.html#tim4-8">4.8</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Real widows are “desolate” and pray “night and day.” But those widows that experience pleasure are “dead while [they] live.” <a href="part0064.html#tim5-5">5.5-6</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">You should help a widow only if she: is over 60 years old, had only one husband, has raised children, has lodged strangers, has “washed the saints’ feet,” has relieved the afflicted, and has “diligently followed very good work.” Otherwise, let them starve. “But the younger widows refuse [to help]: for … they will marry; having damnation.” Besides the young widows are always idle tattlers—“busybodies, spreading things which they ought not … Some are already turned aside after Satan.” <a href="part0064.html#tim5-9">5.9-15</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Publicly humiliate those who sin by announcing their sins in front of God and everybody so “that others may also fear.” <a href="part0064.html#tim5-20">5.20</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Stop drinking water. Drink wine for your stomach’s sake. <a href="part0064.html#tim5-23">5.23</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.” <a href="part0064.html#tim6-1">6.1</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be … ready to distribute.” <a href="part0064.html#tim6-17">6.17-18</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Avoid science, especially that which disagrees with the Bible (“science falsely called”). <a href="part0064.html#tim6-20">6.20</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 <span class="bold">Unto Timothy</span>, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.1-2) <span class="bold">“Paul … Unto Timothy”</span> Although First Timothy claims to have been written by Paul, most scholars believe that it was written after his death.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="tim1-4">4 <span class="bold">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies</span>, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="tim1-9">9 Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="tim1-10">10 For whoremongers, for <span class="bold">them that defile themselves with mankind</span>, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00026.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.10) “Them that defile themselves with mankind” Homosexuals (those “that defile themselves with mankind”) are included on the list of lawless, disobedient, unholy, and profane people.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="tim1-17">17 Now unto <span class="bold">the</span> King eternal, immortal, <span class="bold">invisible</span>, the only wise <span class="bold">God</span>, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
