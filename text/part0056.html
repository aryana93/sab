  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all.</i> — <span class="small">1 Corinthians 14.18</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Paul has an important message in First Corinthians: time is running out. There’s no time for learning; no time for sex, marriage or families. Jesus is coming soon. In the meantime, slaves should obey their masters, women should obey their husbands, and everyone should speak in tongues. Just not as much as Paul.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Highlights:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="corin1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their’s and our’s:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="corin1-7">7 So that ye come behind in no gift; <span class="bold">waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ</span>:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.7) <span class="bold">“Waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may <span class="bold">be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.8) <span class="bold">“Be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="corin1-12">12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, <span class="bold">I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.12) “I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.” Christians started out divided (into followers of Paul, Apollos, Cephas, or Christ), and it has remained so ever since.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.14-16) Poor Paul is confused. First he says that he baptized no one. Well, except for Crispus and Gaius. And maybe Stephanus and his household. He can’t remember if he did it to anyone else.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="corin1-14">14 <span class="bold">I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.14) <span class="bold">“I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius.</span>”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 <span class="bold">Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.15) <span class="bold">“Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 <span class="bold">And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.16) <span class="bold">“And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">17 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text" id="corin1-19"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.19-20) God: the destroyer of wisdom<br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con293">293 Is wisdom a good thing?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 For it is written, <span class="bold">I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.19) <span class="bold">“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? <span class="bold">hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.20) <span class="bold">“Hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="corin1-21">21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, <span class="bold">it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.21) <span class="bold">“It pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</span>” God saves fools and is pleased with their foolishness.<br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con295">295 Is it good to be foolish?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">22 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="corin1-27">27 But <span class="bold">God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise</span>; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</p>

  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con45">45 Is God the author of confusion?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">28 And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 That no flesh should glory in his presence.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1063">1 CORINTHIANS 2</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="corin2-1"><span class="drop-cap">2</span> And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="corin2-2">2 For <span class="bold">I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ</span>, and him crucified.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.2) “I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ.” If you are to be a good Christian you must try to know nothing (except for Jesus, of course).</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="corin2-15">15 But <span class="bold">he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00027.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.15) “He that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.” Christians can judge everything and everybody, but no non-Christian can judge them.<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1064">1 CORINTHIANS 3</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="corin3-1"><span class="drop-cap">3</span> And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="corin3-4">4 For while <span class="bold">one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="corin3-15">15 <span class="bold">If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved;</span> yet so as by fire.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="corin4-1"><span class="drop-cap">4</span> Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?</p>

The law is for our sakes.” According to Paul, God doesn’t give a damn about animals.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord’s supper.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1073">1 CORINTHIANS 12</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="corin12-1"><span class="drop-cap1">12</span> Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 For the body is not one member, but many.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And if they were all one member, where were the body?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 But now are they many members, yet but one body.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">37 And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:</p>
