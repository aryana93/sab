  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">So Joshua smote all the country ... he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.</i> — <span class="small">Joshua 10.40</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">If you believe in a God of peace, you won’t much like the book of Joshua. Because Joshua’s God is a God of war, and he isn’t bothered by collateral damage. Rather, he insists upon it. “So Joshua … utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.” (<a href="part0015.html#josh10-40">10.40</a>)</p>

  <p class="noindent3">And he’s not just an innocent bystander either. He is an active combatant. “The Lord God fought for Israel.” (<a href="part0015.html#josh10-42">10.42</a>) God “slew them with a great slaughter” and even “chased them along the way.” Sometimes he “threw down great stones from heaven,” and once he even stopped the sun from moving so that he and the Israelites could finish all their killing before sundown. (<a href="part0015.html#josh10-10">10.10-12</a>)</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are some highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">Joshua killed “everything that breathed” in each of the cities that he conquered, “as the Lord God of Israel commanded.” <a href="part0015.html#josh6-21">6.21</a>, <a href="part0015.html#josh8-24">8.24-26</a>, <a href="part0015.html#josh10-28">10.28-40</a>, <a href="part0015.html#josh11-8">11.8-21</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">A family is stoned and burned to death (along with their animals) to punish the father (Achan) for looking at “the accursed thing.” “So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger.” <a href="part0015.html#josh7-24">7.24-26</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Joshua kills all the inhabitants of Ai, burns their city, and hangs their king on a tree. <a href="part0015.html#josh8-22">8.22-31</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God curses the Gibeonites to be slaves of the Jews forever. <a href="part0015.html#josh9-21">9.21-27</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He gets right in and fights for the Israelites. He “slew them with a great slaughter” and even “chased them along the way.” What a guy. <a href="part0015.html#josh10-10">10.10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He threw down “great stones from heaven” so that he could kill even more people than the Israelites “slew with the sword.” <a href="part0015.html#josh10-11">10.11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He makes the sun and moon stand still so that Joshua could get all his killing done before dark. It was the first Daylight Savings Time. <a href="part0015.html#josh10-12">10.12-13</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“The Lord fought for Israel.” <a href="part0015.html#josh10-14">10.14</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Joshua kills five kings and hangs them on trees. <a href="part0015.html#josh10-24">10.24-26</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly.” <a href="part0015.html#josh11-20">11.20</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Remember that God “is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.” <a href="part0015.html#josh24-19">24.19</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_188">JOSHUA 1</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="josh1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ minister, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.3-5) God promised to give Joshua all of the land that his “foot shall tread upon.” He said that none of the people he encountered will be able to resist him. But God didn’t keep his promise; many tribes withstood Joshua’s attempt to steal their land. (Jos 15.63, 16.10, 17.12-13, Jg 1.21, 1.27, 3.1-5)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 <span class="bold">Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you</span>, as I said unto Moses.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.3) <span class="bold">“Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 <span class="bold">There shall not any man be able to stand before thee</span> all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.5) <span class="bold">“There shall not any man be able to stand before thee.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 <span class="bold">Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.</span></p>

Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God giveth you to possess it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD’S servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00023.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00024.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.1-4) Joshua’s spies visit and “came unto” a prostitute in Jericho. They weren’t very discreet about it either, since the King of Jericho soon found out about it. The king’s officials ask Rahab to “bring forth the men that are come to thee.”</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_189">JOSHUA 2</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="josh2-1"><span class="drop-cap">2</span> And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And <span class="bold">they went, and came into an harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.1) <span class="bold">“They went, and came into an harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 <span class="bold">And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee,</span> which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.3) <span class="bold">“And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="josh2-4">4 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, <span class="bold">There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were</span>:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.4a) Rahab lies to those who were searching for Joshua’s spies. Lying is condemned several places in the Bible, but Rahab is reworded by God by being spared during the destruction of Jericho (Jos 6.25). And in James (2.24), Rahab is also praised for lying. So the Bible both condemns and approves of lying.<br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con86">86 Is it wrong to lie?</a></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.4b) <span class="bold">“There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that <span class="bold">the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.5) <span class="bold">“The men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="josh2-11">11 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for <span class="bold">the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.11) <span class="bold">“The LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.”</span><br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father’s house, and give me a true token:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And the men answered her, Our life for your’s, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for <span class="bold">her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.15) <span class="bold">“Her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.”</span> Since Rahab’s house was built on the wall, how did she and her family survive when the wall fell down? (See Jos 6.20)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father’s household, home unto thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all things that befell them:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_190">JOSHUA 3</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="josh3-1"><span class="drop-cap">3</span> And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (3.7-17) God “magnifies” Joshua by allowing the priests to cross the Jordan without getting their feet wet. Glory!</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="josh5-1"><span class="drop-cap">5</span> And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00023.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (5.2-3) At God’s command, Joshua makes some knives and circumcises “again the children of Israel the second time” (ouch!) at the “hill of the foreskins.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 At that time <span class="bold">the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(5.2) <span class="bold">“The LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 <span class="bold">And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(5.3) <span class="bold">“And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 For <span class="bold">the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness</span>, till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (5.6) <span class="bold">“The children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness.”</span> It took the Israelites 40 years to travel from Egypt to Canaan, yet such a journey, even at that time, would have taken no more than a few weeks.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(5.13-15) Joshua meets a man with a sword in his hand who claims to be the captain of God’s army. Joshua seemed to think God’s captain was God himself, as he bowed down to worship him. Apparently the God-angel-man guy agreed, telling Joshua to take off his shoe, since he was standing on holy ground (as Moses was told to do in Exodus 3.5). But whoever it was, he disappeared, never to return again.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 And it came to pass, when <span class="bold">Joshua</span> was by Jericho, that he <span class="bold">lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man</span> over against him <span class="bold">with his sword drawn</span> in his hand: <span class="bold">and Joshua</span> went unto him, and <span class="bold">said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(5.13) <span class="bold">“Joshua … lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man … with his sword drawn … and Joshua … said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 <span class="bold">And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship</span>, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(5.14) <span class="bold">“And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 <span class="bold">And the captain of the LORD’S host said unto Joshua</span>, <span class="bold">Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And Joshua did so.</span></p>

  God’s 31st Killing</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, <span class="bold">Cursed be the man</span> before the LORD, <span class="bold">that</span> riseth up and <span class="bold">buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.</span></p>

Well, Jericho still exists today, and is often considered to be the world’s oldest, continuously occupied city.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">27 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country.</p>

God told Joshua to do unto Ai as they did unto Jericho, escept that this time they could keep some of the loot for themselves (instead of giving it all to him). So that’s what they did. They killed the soldiers, murdered all the women and children, burned the city, killed the king of Ai, and hung his dead body on a tree. Just like God told them to do. God’s 33rd Killing</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="josh8-1"><span class="drop-cap">8</span> And <span class="bold">the LORD said unto Joshua</span>, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, <span class="bold">go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them and Ai.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and <span class="bold">they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="josh10-1"><span class="drop-cap1">10</span> Now it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">The five kings from these cities (the Amorite coalition) decided to attack the Israelites. Then God gets involved.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">God tells Joshua not to worry; he has given the Amorites into his hand, and the Amorites would run away when attacked.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">So Joshua attacked, but God did most of the dirty work. He “discomfited” them and even “chased them along the way,” throwing down giant hailstones from heaven that killed even more Amorites than the Israelite army.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">Then, in one of his most impressive feats in the entire Bible, God made the sun and the moon stop moving for 24 hours so that Joshua could get all his killing done in broad daylight. “The Lord God fought for Israel.” God’s 34th Killing</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 And <span class="bold">the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand</span>; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(10.11) <span class="bold">“The LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them … and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.”</span> As the Amorites try to escape, God sends down huge hailstones and kills even more of them.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(10.12-13) In a divine type of daylight savings time, God makes the sun stand still so that Joshua can get all his killing done before dark.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="josh10-12">12 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, <span class="bold">Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? <span class="bold">So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(10.13) <span class="bold">“So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God concerning me and thee in Kadesh-barnea.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children’s for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that hath fought for you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea westward.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 <span class="bold">One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God, he it is that fighteth for you</span>, as he hath promised you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the LORD your God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="josh23-14">14 And, behold, this day <span class="bold">I am going the way of all the earth</span>: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.</p>
