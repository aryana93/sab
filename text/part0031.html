  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me … stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.</i> — <span class="small">Song of Solomon 2.6-7</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">The Song of Solomon is an erotic love poem in which the name of God isn’t even mentioned. Aren’t you glad it is in the Bible? (Joseph Smith wasn’t. It is the only book in the King James Version that he left out of his “Inspired Version.”)</p>
