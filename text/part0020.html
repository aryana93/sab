  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">He slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that pisseth against a wall … according to the word of the LORD.</i> — <span class="small">1 Kings 16.11-12</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">God, I love the way First Kings starts!</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Old king David could get no heat (and David was used to getting a lot of heat), so they searched through the kingdom for a young virgin that could do the trick for him. They found one, too, (Abishag) and “the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.” Shucks! <a href="part0020.html#king1-1">1.1-4</a></p>

  <p class="noindent3">It gets boring toward the middle with the construction of the temple, but it picks up toward the end. See chapter 20 for five of God’s killings, more than any other chapter in the Bible.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="king1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> Now <span class="bold">king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.1) <span class="bold">“King David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he gat no heat.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 Wherefore his servants said unto him, <span class="bold">Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.2) <span class="bold">“Let there be sought for my Lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 <span class="bold">So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag</span> a Shunammite, <span class="bold">and brought her to the king.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.3) <span class="bold">“So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag … and brought her to the king.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.4) <span class="bold">“And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and ministered to him: but the king knew her not.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his mother bare him after Absalom.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah the king’s servants:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="king1-10">10 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother, he called not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king said, What wouldest thou?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou knowest it not:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also came in.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into the king’s presence, and stood before the king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 Then Bath-sheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">34 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">35 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">37 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">39 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">40 And all the people came up after him, and <span class="bold">the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.40) <span class="bold">“The people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.”</span> When Solomon was anointed king the people sang and shouted so loudly that it caused an earthquake!</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">41 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">42 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">43 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David hath made Solomon king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">45 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">47 And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">48 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes even seeing it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">49 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and went every man his way.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">50 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the sword.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">52 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">53 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Moreover <span class="bold">thou knowest</span> also <span class="bold">what Joab</span> the son of Zeruiah <span class="bold">did to me</span>, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his feet.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and <span class="bold">let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.5-6) <span class="bold">“Thou knowest … what Joab … did to me … let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And, behold, thou hast with thee <span class="bold">Shimei</span> the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which <span class="bold">cursed me with a grievous curse</span> in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 <span class="bold">Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years: seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was established greatly.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="king2-13">13 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him, Say on.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I will not say thee nay.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">26 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.29) <span class="bold">“Solomon sent Benaiah … saying, Go, fall upon him.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 And <span class="bold">the king said unto him</span>, Do as he hath said, and <span class="bold">fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.31-32) “The king said unto him … fall upon him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father. And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head.”</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.33a) “Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever.” Solomon justifies the murder of Joab by saying that Joab also was a murderer, and that the blood of Joab’s victims “shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever.”<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each ten cubits high.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm trees.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">34 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; <span class="bold">the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits</span>, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">27 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">34 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">35 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">36 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">37 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">38 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the ten bases one laver.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">39 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">40 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">41 The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">42 And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">43 And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">44 And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">45 And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">46 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">47 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">48 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread was,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">49 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">50 And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">51 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king’s house,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him; and they pleased him not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_300">1 KINGS 10</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="king10-1"><span class="drop-cap1">10</span> And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and the house that he had built,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And <span class="bold">she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold</span>, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (10.10) “She gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold.” Since a talent was about 75 pounds, the Queen of Sheba gave Solomon 9000 pounds of gold, which would be worth more than 200 million U.S. dollars today.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Now <span class="bold">the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,</span></p>

(666 talents of gold would weigh about 50,000 pounds and would be worth about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars today.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 And <span class="bold">the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones</span>, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (10.27) <span class="bold">“The king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones.”</span> When Solomon was king, silver was as common as stones in Jerusalem.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">28 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy servants for ever.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s loins.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel that they gave him;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">31 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Beth-el the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="king21-1"><span class="drop-cap1">21</span> And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">44 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">46 <span class="bold">And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took out of the land.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">47 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">49 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">52 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">53 For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</p>
