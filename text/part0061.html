  <p class="noindent">Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy. — <span class="small">Colossians 2.8</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">This is one of Paul’s disputed letters. Some scholars believe that Paul wrote it; others think it was forged by one of his followers. But whoever wrote it, it’s not of much interest to skeptics, except to note that wives must submit to their husbands, slaves must obey their masters, and everyone needs to beware of philosophy.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are the highlights:</p>
