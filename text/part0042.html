But this is unlikely since</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">“Bethlehem Ephratah” in Micah 5.2 refers not to a town, but to a clan: the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb’s second wife, Ephrathah (1 Chr 2.18, 2.50-52, 4.4).</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">The prophecy (if that is what it is) does not refer to the Messiah, but rather to a military leader, as can be seen from verse 5.6. This leader is supposed to defeat the Assyrians, which, of course, Jesus never did.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">It should also be noted that Matthew altered the text of Micah 5.2 by saying: “And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda” rather than “Bethlehem Ephratah” as is said in Micah 5.2. He did this, intentionally no doubt, to make the verse appear to refer to the town of Bethlehem rather than the family clan.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.</p>
