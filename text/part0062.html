  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</i> — <span class="small">1 Thessalonians 5.21</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">First Thessalonians, written by Paul around 49 CE, is probably the first Christian writing that we have today. In it we learn that Jesus will come soon. Until then we need to hold on to our vessels (wives or penises, depending on translation) in a holy way (<a href="part0062.html#thess4-4">4.4</a>).</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are some highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">Paul, with his usual modesty, proclaims that he is holy, just, and blameless. <a href="part0062.html#thess2-10">2.10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He accuses the Jews of killing Jesus, persecuting the prophets, displeasing God, and being “contrary to all men.” The wrath of God will “come upon them to the uttermost.” <a href="part0062.html#thess2-14">2.14-16</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Paul would have come to visit the Thessalonians but Satan stopped him. <a href="part0062.html#thess2-18">2.18</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He expected Jesus to return within his lifetime and those of his followers. <a href="part0062.html#thess3-13">3.13</a>, <a href="part0062.html#thess4-15">4.15-17</a>, <a href="part0062.html#thess5-23">5.23</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour.” <a href="part0062.html#thess4-4">4.4</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“We which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.” Christians get the idea of the rapture from this verse. <a href="part0062.html#thess4-17">4.17</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.” <a href="part0062.html#thess5-21">5.21</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.” <a href="part0062.html#thess5-26">5.26</a></li>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="thess1-10">10 And to wait for <span class="bold">his Son</span> from heaven, <span class="bold">whom he raised from the dead</span>, even Jesus, which delivered us from <span class="bold">the wrath to come</span>.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1108">1 THESSALONIANS 2</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="thess2-1"><span class="drop-cap">2</span> For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="thess2-10">10 <span class="bold">Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you</span> that believe:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.10) “Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you.” Paul, with his usual modesty, proclaims that he is holy, just, and blameless.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00027.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00029.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.14-16) Paul accuses the Jews of killing Jesus, along with their own prophets, displeasing God, and being “contrary to all men.” He concludes that the wrath of God will “come upon them to the uttermost.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="thess2-14">14 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of <span class="bold">the Jews</span>:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Who both <span class="bold">killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men</span>:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.14-15) <span class="bold">“The Jews … killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for <span class="bold">the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.16) “The wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">17 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="thess2-18">18 Wherefore <span class="bold">we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.18) <span class="bold">“We would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? <span class="bold">Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.19) <span class="bold">“Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?”</span> Paul believed that those alive in 49 CE would live to see Jesus come.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 For ye are our glory and joy.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1109">1 THESSALONIANS 3</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="thess3-1"><span class="drop-cap">3</span> Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (3.4, 13) Paul thought that the tribulation that he believed would precede Jesus’ coming had already passed, and that Jesus would come within his lifetime.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 For verily, when we were with you, <span class="bold">we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass</span>, and ye know.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.4) <span class="bold">“We told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="thess3-13">13 To the end <span class="bold">he may stablish your hearts</span> unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, <span class="bold">at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ</span> with all his saints.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.13) “He may stablish your hearts … at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1110">1 THESSALONIANS 4</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="thess4-1"><span class="drop-cap">4</span> Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="thess4-4">4 That <span class="bold">every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour</span>;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00023.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (4.4) <span class="bold">“Every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour.”</span> Every man should know how to possess his penis or his wife (depending on the translation) in a holy way.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="thess4-6">6 <span class="bold">That no man</span> go beyond and <span class="bold">defraud his brother in any matter</span>: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00028.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (4.6) <span class="bold">“That no man … defraud his brother in any matter”</span><br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con91">91 Is it wrong to steal?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, <span class="bold">concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00025.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (4.13) “Concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.” Christians shouldn’t mourn the death of their fellow believers. They’ll be OK and you’ll see them later in heaven. The people you should mourn are dead nonbelievers. They have no hope; they will be tortured forever in hell.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="thess4-15">15 For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that <span class="bold">we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (4:15) <span class="bold">“We which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.”</span> 1 Thessalonians was one of the first Christian writings, yet already (ca.50 CE) believers were getting impatient about Jesus’ supposed return. Their fellow believers were dying and yet Jesus still hadn’t come. What the hell is taking him? And what happens to dead believers? Will they get to see Jesus return? Paul had a lot of ‘splainin to do.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 <span class="bold">For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel</span>, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (4.16) <span class="bold">“For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel.”</span> From this verse and Jude 9, the Jehovah’s Witnesses figure that Jesus is really the archangel Michael.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="thess4-17">17 Then <span class="bold">we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air</span>: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (4.17) <span class="bold">“We which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air.”</span> Christians get the idea of the rapture from this verse.

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="thess5-1"><span class="drop-cap">5</span> But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</p>
