  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">Then said Esther … let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows. And the king commanded it so to be done … and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.</i> — <span class="small">Esther 9.13-14</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Esther is one of the two books in the Bible in which God is not even mentioned (the other is the Song of Solomon).</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Maybe that’s why some Bible believers, such as Martin Luther, believed that it should be excluded from the Bible. In Luther’s case, however, it probably had more to do with his extreme antisemitism. Because the point of the Book of Esther, if it has a point, is this: God loves Jews more than everyone else and anyone who has ever had a bad thought about them should be killed. (And Luther had lots of bad thoughts about Jews.)</p>

  <p class="noindent3">There is a whole series of killings in Esther, all of them to avenge antisemitism. But since the Book of Esther does not mention God’s name, it’s difficult to blame him directly for these killings. Still, since the fact that Esther is included in the Bible, the God of the Bible must approve of the killings, insofar as a nonexistent being can approve of anything.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">The Book of Esther also has an important message for women: your job in life is to look pretty and to please, honor, and obey men. If that means dancing naked in front of your husband’s drunken guests, dance naked. Be an Esther, not a Vashti. (Which is, of course, bad advice. Vashti is the hero of the Book of Esther and she gets my vote for the best person in the Bible.)</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are some highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">King Ahasuerus throws a party and encourages his guests to drink to excess. Then, when they are all drunk, he orders Queen Vashti to show her stuff before him and his guests. <a href="part0026.html#est1-7">1.7-11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Queen Vashti (the real heroine of the Book of Esther) refuses to display herself in front of the king’s drunken guests. <a href="part0026.html#est1-7">1.7-12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">For her refusal, Vashti is stripped of her crown and came “no more before king.” <a href="part0026.html#est1-13">1.13-19</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Because of Vashti’s disobedience the king decrees that “all the wives shall give to their husbands honor” and “that every man should bear rule over his own house.” <a href="part0026.html#est1-20">1.20-22</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“All the fair young virgins” throughout the kingdom are brought before the king and the one that “pleaseth” him the most will replace Queen Vashti. <a href="part0026.html#est2-2">2.2-4</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Esther wins the please-the-king babe contest. <a href="part0026.html#est2-8">2.8-9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">But since women are dirty, she must be “purified” for twelve months before she can be made queen. <a href="part0026.html#est2-12">2.12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Esther has two men hung on a tree. <a href="part0026.html#est2-23">2.23</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">She has Haman and his ten sons hung. <a href="part0026.html#est7-10">7.10</a>, <a href="part0026.html#est9-13">9.13</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">At Esther’s request, the king orders everyone in the empire who planned to kill Jews to be killed by Jews, along with their wives and children. <a href="part0026.html#est8-1">8.1-19</a></li>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 On the seventh day, <span class="bold">when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded</span> Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">18 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto all the king’s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_427">ESTHER 2</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="est2-1"><span class="drop-cap">2</span> After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="est2-2">2 Then said the king’s servants that ministered unto him, <span class="bold">Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, <span class="bold">that they may gather together all the fair young virgins</span> unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 <span class="bold">And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti</span>. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00024.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00023.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.2-4) “All the fair young virgins” throughout the kingdom are brought before the king, and the one that “pleaseth” the king the most will replace Vashti.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.2-4) “Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king … that they may gather together all the fair young virgins … And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00021.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00024.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00023.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.8-17) When it was Esther’s turn to “go in unto the king,” she pleases the king the most. So, having won the sex contest, she is made queen in Vashti’s place.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="est2-8">8 So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 <span class="bold">And the maiden pleased him</span>, and she obtained kindness of him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her, out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.8-9) <span class="bold">“Esther was brought also unto the king’s house … And the maiden pleased him.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="est2-12">12 Now <span class="bold">when every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women</span>, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 <span class="bold">Then thus came every maiden unto the king</span>; whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.12-13) <span class="bold">“When every maid’s turn was come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the manner of the women … Then thus came every maiden unto the king.”</span> Since women are inherently dirty, Esther must be “purified” for twelve months before she can be made queen.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And <span class="bold">the king loved Esther above all the women</span>, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight <span class="bold">more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.15-17) “When the turn of Esther … was come to go in unto the king … the king loved Esther above all the women … more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">18 Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00025.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.21-23) With nothing more than suspicion and hearsay, Esther has two men hanged (after a brief inquisition).</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">21 In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, <span class="bold">two of the king’s chamberlains</span>, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth, and <span class="bold">sought to lay hand on the king</span> Ahasuerus.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.21) <span class="bold">“Two of the king’s chamberlains … sought to lay hands on the king.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">23 And <span class="bold">when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore they were both hanged on a tree:</span> and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had shewed him the people of Mordecai: <span class="bold">wherefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom</span> of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And <span class="bold">Haman said unto king Ahasuerus</span>, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to suffer them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 If it please the king, <span class="bold">let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver</span> to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or woman, shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (5.14) <span class="bold">“Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon … And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.”</span> Haman’s wife and friends tell Haman to have a 25 meter high gallows be made to hang Mordecai on. So they did that in a single day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="est5-1"><span class="drop-cap">5</span> Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have prepared for him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.</p>
