  <p class="noindent">For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry. — <span class="small">Hebrews 10.37</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Although the author of Hebrews never claims to be Paul (and wasn’t), he wanted people to think that he was (13.23). And it worked, which is why Hebrews is now part of the New Testament.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">I find the book tiresome to read, though there is some fun stuff in chapter 11. The author praises the most atrocious acts in the Hebrew Bible and credits them all to faith. If that’s what faith can do, it’s a good thing to stay away from.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are the highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">The author of Hebrews believed that he was living in the “last days.” <a href="part0068.html#heb1-2">1.2</a>, <a href="part0068.html#heb9-26">9.26</a>, <a href="part0068.html#heb10-25">10.25</a>, <a href="part0068.html#heb10-37">10.37</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Every skeptic and nonbeliever has “an evil heart of unbelief.” <a href="part0068.html#heb3-12">3.12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">It is impossible for fallen-away Christians to be saved. (Didn’t the author know about confession or the finality of being saved?) <a href="part0068.html#heb6-4">6.4-6</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Apostates will burn in hell with all the other non-believers. <a href="part0068.html#heb6-8">6.8</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Melchisedec had no father or mother. He was never born (he just appeared ready-made by God) and he never died. He’s still around somewhere. <a href="part0068.html#heb7-3">7.3</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God will not forgive us unless we shed the blood of some innocent creature. <a href="part0068.html#heb9-13">9.13-22</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Those who disobeyed the Hebrew Bible’s laws were killed without mercy. It will be much worse for those who displease Jesus. <a href="part0068.html#heb10-28">10.28-29</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.” <a href="part0068.html#heb10-31">10.31</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Faith is believing without evidence things that you wish were true (but aren’t). <a href="part0068.html#heb11-1">11.1</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">If you’re not a Christian, it’s impossible to please God. <a href="part0068.html#heb11-1">11.6</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“By faith Noah … condemned the world.” <a href="part0068.html#heb11-7">11.7</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed.” <a href="part0068.html#heb11-11">11.11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Abraham … offered up Isaac … his only begotten son.” (To the author of Hebrews this was a good thing.) <a href="part0068.html#heb11-17">11.17</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Moses “kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.” <a href="part0068.html#heb11-28">11.28</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“By faith the walls of Jericho fell down.” <a href="part0068.html#heb11-30">11.30</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not.” <a href="part0068.html#heb11-31">11.31</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">The heroes of faith (Samson, Jephthah, David, and Samuel). It would be hard to find a more monstrous group than these guys. <a href="part0068.html#heb11-32">11.32</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Others were tortured … that they might obtain a better resurrection.” <a href="part0068.html#heb11-35">11.35</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God always hurts the ones he loves. If he doesn’t hurt you, you’re a bastard, not a son. <a href="part0068.html#heb12-6">12.6-8</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God ordered animals to be “stoned, or thrust through with a dart” if they “so much as … touch the mountain.” <a href="part0068.html#heb12-20">12.20</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Avoid “strange doctrines.” Those who do so will avoid nearly everything in the Bible. <a href="part0068.html#heb13-9">13.9</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="heb1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> <span class="bold">God</span>, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="heb1-2">2 <span class="bold">Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son</span>, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.1-2) <span class="bold">“God … hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son.”</span> The author of Hebrews believed that he was living in the “last days.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="heb1-8">8 But <span class="bold">unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever</span>: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.8) “Unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever.”<br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con349">349 Is Jesus God?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And, <span class="bold">Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth</span>; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.10) “Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth.” God set the earth on a foundation; therefore, it does not move.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="heb1-11">11 <span class="bold">They shall perish</span>; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.11) <span class="bold">“They</span> [the earth and its foundations] <span class="bold">shall perish.”</span><br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con147">147 Will the earth last forever?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1130">HEBREWS 2</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="heb2-1"><span class="drop-cap">2</span> Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="heb2-16">16 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but <span class="bold">he took on him the seed of Abraham.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.16) <span class="bold">“He took on him the seed of Abraham.”</span><br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con329">329 Was Joseph the father of Jesus?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">17 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1131">HEBREWS 3</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="heb3-1"><span class="drop-cap">3</span> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, <span class="bold">Christ Jesus</span>;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.1-3) “Christ Jesus … was counted worthy of more glory than Moses.”<br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con160">160 Who was the greatest prophet?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 For this man <span class="bold">was counted worthy of more glory than Moses</span>, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="heb3-12">12 <span class="bold">Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief</span>, in departing from the living God.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00027.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (3.12) “Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief.” Every skeptic and nonbeliever has “an evil heart of unbelief.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1132">HEBREWS 4</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="heb4-1"><span class="drop-cap">4</span> Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1133">HEBREWS 5</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="heb5-1"><span class="drop-cap">5</span> For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1134">HEBREWS 6</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="heb6-1"><span class="drop-cap">6</span> Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="heb7-3">3 <span class="bold">Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (7.3) <span class="bold">“Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.”</span> Melchisedec had no father or mother. He was never born (he just appeared ready-made by God) and he never died. He’s still around somewhere.<br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con19">19 Is everyone descended from Adam?</a><br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con24">24 Must everyone die?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 Now <span class="bold">consider how great this man was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people’s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="heb8-1"><span class="drop-cap">8</span> Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="heb9-1"><span class="drop-cap">9</span> Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="heb9-4">4 Which had the golden censer, and <span class="bold">the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(9.4) “The ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant.” According to this verse, the ark of the covenant had a lot more in it that was reported in 1 Kings 8.9 and 2 Chronicles 5.10, both of which say that the ark had only Moses’ tablets. From the dimensions of the ark in Exodus 25.10, Aaron’s staff could hardly have fit anyway, since the ark was a box only 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cubits. But, hey, maybe Aaron was a little short guy, or they broke his rod into pieces, or they just crammed it all in somehow. Who knows?<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of the people:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 <span class="bold">How much more shall the blood of Christ</span>, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(9.14) <span class="bold">“How much more shall the blood of Christ.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that <span class="bold">by means of death</span>, for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, <span class="bold">they which are called</span> might <span class="bold">receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(9.15) <span class="bold">“By means of death … they which are called … receive the promise of eternal inheritance.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 For <span class="bold">where a testament is, there must also</span> of necessity <span class="bold">be</span> the <span class="bold">death</span> of the testator.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(9.16) “Where a testament is, there must also … be … death.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Whereupon <span class="bold">neither</span> the first <span class="bold">testament was dedicated without blood.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(9.18) “Neither … testament was dedicated without blood.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 For when <span class="bold">Moses</span> had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he <span class="bold">took the blood of calves and of goats</span>, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, <span class="bold">and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(9.19) <span class="bold">“Moses … took the blood of calves and of goats … and sprinkled both the book, and all the people.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 Saying, <span class="bold">This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(9.20) “This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.”</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(9.21) <span class="bold">“Sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">22 And almost <span class="bold">all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(9.22) <span class="bold">“All things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="heb9-26">26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once <span class="bold">in the end of the world hath he appeared</span> to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (9.26) “In the end of the world hath he appeared.” Jesus appeared when the world was about to end. (It ended nearly two thousand years ago.)</p>
