  <h3 class="chaph1" id="chap41">MARK</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</i> — <span class="small">Mark 3.21</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Mark is the shortest gospel and was the first to be written. It served as source material for the other synoptic gospels (Matthew and Luke). As with the others, no one knows who the author was, but that didn’t stop believers from claiming its author was Mark, the companion of Peter. The original gospel ended without anyone seeing the resurrected Jesus or any of the cool stuff about the signs of true believers (snake handling, casting out devils, drinking poison, etc.) and the unconditional consequence of non-belief (“He who believeth not is damned.”)—which was added later (<a href="part0051.html#mark16-9">16.9-20</a>). Believers have been embarrassed by it ever since.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">Jesus healed “all that were diseased” by casting out devils. The devils knew Jesus was the Son of God, but Jesus told them to shut up about it. <a href="part0051.html#mark1-32">1.32-34</a>, <a href="part0051.html#mark3-11">3.11-12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He gets angry at those who said that he had an unclean spirit, so he announces the unforgivable sin: blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. <a href="part0051.html#mark3-29">3.29</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He shows disrespect for his mother and family by asking, “Who is my mother, or my brethren?” <a href="part0051.html#mark3-31">3.31-34</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He explains why he speaks in parables: to confuse people so they will go to hell. <a href="part0051.html#mark4-10">4.10-12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He says that those who have been less fortunate in this life will have it even worse in the life to come. <a href="part0051.html#mark4-25">4.25</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He sends the devils into 2000 pigs, causing them to drown in the sea. <a href="part0051.html#mark5-11">5.11-17</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Any city that doesn’t “receive” the followers of Jesus will be destroyed in a manner even more savage than that of Sodom and Gomorrah. <a href="part0051.html#mark6-11">6.11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children according to Old Testament law. <a href="part0051.html#mark7-9">7.9-10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He refused to cast out a devil from a Greek woman’s daughter, calling her a “dog”. After much pleading, he finally agrees to cast out her daughter’s devil. <a href="part0051.html#mark7-25">7.25-30</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He put his fingers in a deaf man’s ears, then spit and touched his tongue, and cured a blind man by spitting in his eyes. <a href="part0051.html#mark7-32">7.32-35</a>, <a href="part0051.html#mark8-22">8.22-23</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He falsely prophesied that the end of the world would come within his listeners’ lifetimes. 9.1, <a href="part0051.html#mark13-30">13.30</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He said that John the Baptist was Elijah, but John the Baptist explicitly denied it in John <a href="part0053.html#john1-21">1.21</a>. <a href="part0051.html#mark9-13">9.13</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“He that believeth not shall be damned.” <a href="part0051.html#mark16-16">16.16</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">True followers of Christ routinely perform the following tricks: cast out devils, speak in tongues, handle poisonous snakes, drink poisons without harm, and cure the sick by touching them. <a href="part0051.html#mark16-17">16.17-18</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_957">MARK 1</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="mark1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 <span class="bold">As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.2) <span class="bold">“As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.”</span> This verse claims that John the Baptist fulfilled the prophecy given in Malachi (3.1, 4.1, 5). But the Malachi prophecy says that God will send Elijah before “the great and dreadful day of the LORD” in which the world will be consumed by fire. John the Baptist flatly denied that he was Elijah (Elias) in John 1.21 and the earth was not destroyed after John’s appearance.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="mark1-9">9 And it came to pass in those days, that <span class="bold">Jesus</span> came from Nazareth of Galilee, and <span class="bold">was baptized of John in Jordan.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 <span class="bold">And</span> straightway coming up out of the water, he saw <span class="bold">the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 Now <span class="bold">after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee</span>, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.14) <span class="bold">“After that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Now <span class="bold">as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea</span>: for they were fishers.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.16) <span class="bold">“As he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">17 And <span class="bold">Jesus said</span> unto them, <span class="bold">Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.17) <span class="bold">“Jesus said … Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">18 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">22 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</p>
