  <h3 class="chaph1" id="chap26">EZEKIEL</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</i> — <span class="small">Ezekiel 23.20</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">For pure filthiness, you just can’t beat Ezekiel. Donkey-sized penises, women plucking off their breasts, baking bread with human dung, or getting drunk on human blood—you won’t find stuff like this anywhere else.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are the highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">Ezekiel sees God’s loins (“the glory of the Lord”), which were on fire. <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze1-27">1.27</a>, <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze8-2">8.2</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God makes Ezekiel lay on his right side for 390 days, and then on his left side for another 40 days. <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze4-4">4.4-8</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He tells Ezekiel to bake and eat bread that is made with the “dung that cometh out of man.” <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze4-12">4.12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He tells him to shave his head and beard, divide the cut hair into thirds, burn one portion, smite the second with a knife, and scatter the third in the wind. <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze5-1">5.1-3</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He will force fathers to eat their sons and sons to eat their fathers and will cause every man’s sword to be against his brother. <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze5-10">5.10</a>, <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze38-21">38.21-23</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God will slaughter everyone by killing one third with plagues, one third with famines, and one third with wars. If any somehow survive, he’ll send “evil beasts” to devour them. Finally, after he’s done killing, he “will be comforted.” <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze5-11">5.11-17</a>, <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze6-5">6.5</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He tells Ezekiel to clap his hands and stamp his feet while saying, “they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.” <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze6-11">6.11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He is mad at everyone and no one will escape his wrath. He’ll kill them all— good and bad, just and unjust—with war, disease, and starvation. He will ignore them when they beg for mercy. “Horror shall cover them” and “they shall know that I am the Lord.” <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze7-3">7.3-11</a>, <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze7-14">7.14-27</a>, <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze8-18">8.18</a>, <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze12-15">12.15-16</a>, <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze21-3">21.3-5</a>, <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze32-9">32.9-15</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He dislikes women and pillows. “Woe to the women that sew pillows … be hold, I am against your pillows.” <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze13-17">13.17-21</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He deceives some of his prophets and then kills them for believing his lies. <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze14-9">14.9</a>, <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze20-25">20.25</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He dresses up Jerusalem, cleans off the blood that she was wallowing in, and compliments her on her nice hair and breasts. <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze16-8">16.8</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">After exposing her nakedness, God will give her “blood in fury and jealousy” and strip her naked once more. Then he’ll have her stoned “with stones and thrust through with swords.” <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze16-38">16.38-41</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God’s ex-girlfriend (Jerusalem) had sex with every man that passed by. She especially liked the Egyptians with big penises. If no one was available, she “committed whoredom” with “images of men.” <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze16-15">16.15-26</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">A just man never gets near a menstruating woman. <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze18-5">18.5-6</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.” <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze23-20">23.20</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“They shall take away thy nose and thine ears … Thou shalt … pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord.” <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze23-25">23.25</a>, <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze23-34">34</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God killed Ezekiel’s wife to demonstrate his intention to kill the Israelites’ children. Just as God told Ezekiel not to mourn his wife’s death, God forbids the parents to mourn the death of their children. <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze24-15">24.15-24</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He showed Ezekiel how to join together dead people’s bones and then bring them back to life. (The leg bone connected to the thigh bone.) <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze37-7">37.7-10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He is preparing a feast for the birds and beasts. They will eat human flesh until they’re full and drink human blood until they’re drunk. <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze39-4">39.4</a>, <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze17-20">17-20</a></li>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.1) <span class="bold">“Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month … that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.”</span> Ezekiel begins by telling us what day it is. It’s the 30th year, 4th month, and 5th day. But the 30th year etc. of what exactly? (See also <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze8-1">8.1</a>, <a href="part0035_split_000.html#eze20-1">20.1</a>, <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze24-1">24.1</a>, <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze26-1">26.1</a>, <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze29-1">29.1</a>, <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze29-17">29.17</a>, <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze30-20">30.20</a>, <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze31-1">31.1</a>, <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze32-1">32.1</a>, <a href="part0035_split_001.html#eze32-17">32.17</a>)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 The word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> <img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.4-28) Ezekiel experiences what some say is the first recorded UFO sighting.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 And <span class="bold">I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself</span>, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as <span class="bold">the colour of amber</span>, out of the midst of the fire.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.4) <span class="bold">“I looked and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself … the color of amber.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.5-28) Ezekiel sees creatures that have four faces (human, lion, ox, and eagle), four wings, and straight feet with calf’s soles.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 Also <span class="bold">out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures.</span> And this was their appearance; <span class="bold">they had the likeness of a man.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.5) <span class="bold">“Out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. … they had the likeness of a man.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 And <span class="bold">every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.6) <span class="bold">“Every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 And <span class="bold">their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.7) <span class="bold">“Their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 And <span class="bold">they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides</span>; and they four had their faces and their wings.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.8) <span class="bold">“They had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 <span class="bold">Their wings were joined one to another</span>; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.9) <span class="bold">“Their wings were joined one to another.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 As for the likeness of their faces, <span class="bold">they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.10) <span class="bold">“They four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 <span class="bold">Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.11) <span class="bold">“Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, <span class="bold">their appearance was like burning coals of fire,</span> and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; <span class="bold">and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.13) <span class="bold">“Their appearance was like burning coals of fire … and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Now <span class="bold">as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.15) “As I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and <span class="bold">their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.16) <span class="bold">“Their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">17 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 <span class="bold">As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.18) “As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 And <span class="bold">when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.19) <span class="bold">“When the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for <span class="bold">the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for <span class="bold">the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.20-21) <span class="bold">“The spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.22-26) The firmament</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">22 And the likeness of <span class="bold">the firmament</span> upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of <span class="bold">the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.22) <span class="bold">“The firmament … the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">23 And <span class="bold">under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.23) <span class="bold">“Under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">24 And when they went, <span class="bold">I heard the noise of their wings</span>, like the noise of great waters, <span class="bold">as the voice of the Almighty</span>, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.24) <span class="bold">“I heard the noise of their wings … as the voice of the Almighty.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">25 And <span class="bold">there was a voice from the firmament</span> that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 <span class="bold">And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne</span>, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: <span class="bold">and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.25-26) “There was a voice from the firmament … and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne … and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.”</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (1.27-28) When Ezekiel saw God’s loins (“the glory of the Lord”), which were on fire, he fell on his face.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="eze1-27">27 And <span class="bold">I saw</span> as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from <span class="bold">the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.27) <span class="bold">“I saw … the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.”</span><br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con49">49 Can God be seen?</a><br class="calibre9" />
    <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre" /><a href="part0077.html#con17">17 Does God have a body?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.28) <span class="bold">“This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face.”</span></p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_803">EZEKIEL 2</h4>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (2.1-7) After Ezekiel saw God’s loins (“the glory of the Lord”), he fell on his face. (1.27-28) Then God tells him to stand up and get ready to tell the Israelites how awful they are.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="eze2-1"><span class="drop-cap">2</span> And <span class="bold">he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.1) <span class="bold">“He said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 <span class="bold">And the spirit entered into me</span> when he spake unto me, <span class="bold">and set me upon my feet</span>, that I heard him that spake unto me.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.2) <span class="bold">“And the spirit entered into me … and set me upon my feet.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 For they are impudent children and stiffhearted. I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And <span class="bold">thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.7) “Thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.”</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (2.8-9) But first, God wants Ezekiel to eat a scroll. And sure enough, a detached hand shows up from out of nowhere with a scroll for Ezekiel to eat.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.8) <span class="bold">“Open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.9) <span class="bold">“And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_804">EZEKIEL 3</h4>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (3.1-3.3) God tells Ezekiel to eat a scroll and to “fill his bowels” with it. He does, and finds it to be as sweet as honey.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="eze3-1"><span class="drop-cap">3</span> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.1) <span class="bold">“He said unto me, Son of man … eat this roll.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.2) <span class="bold">“So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.3) <span class="bold">“And he said unto me, Son of man … fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (3.4-7) After Ezekiel eats the scroll, God sends him off to preach to the Israelites, though God knows they won’t listen to him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.4) <span class="bold">“He said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.7) <span class="bold">“But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre" /> (3.12-14) A spirit takes Ezekiel to places where he hears voices, wings, wheels, and whatnot.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.12) <span class="bold">“Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.13) <span class="bold">“I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(3.14) <span class="bold">“So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away.”</span></p>
