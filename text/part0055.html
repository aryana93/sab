  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</i> — <span class="small">Romans 14.5</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Paul was a bad influence on Christianity. Nowhere is this more evident than in his epistle to the Romans. Here Paul fully exposes his nastiest belief: that salvation is a completely arbitrary decision on the part of God; none of us has anything to do with it. The only free will that exists in the universe is God’s.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">

    <li class="calibre8">Those who slander (or criticize?) Paul are damned by God. <a href="part0055.html#roma3-8">3.8</a></li>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="roma1-16">16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto <span class="bold">salvation to every one that believeth</span>; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="roma1-20">20 For <span class="bold">the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse</span>:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.25) <span class="bold">“Served the creature more than the Creator”</span> The Religious Right often uses Romans 1.21-25 to condemn environmentalists.</p>

This is the only clear reference to lesbians in the Bible.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">Notice, though, that it is God who makes gay people gay, by giving “them up to vile affections.” So according to the Bible, gay people don’t choose to be gay; they are gay because God made them that way (to punish them for God knows what).</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (16.1) <span class="bold">“Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church.”</span> The Revised Standard Version calls Phoebe a “deaconess”, which would make would make her a church leader. If the RSV translation is correct, this verse contradicts the requirement that women not be permitted to teach and that they must be silent in church. (1 Cor 14.34-35, 1 Tim 2.11-12).<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (16.7) “Junia … of note among the apostles” Was there a woman apostle? That is how some interpret this verse and use it to justify a more active role for women in the church.<br class="calibre9"/>
