  <p class="Bible-Text2">20 Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="act5-29">29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, <span class="bold">We ought to obey God rather than men.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">34 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">35 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">36 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">41 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And <span class="bold">Stephen</span>, full of faith and power, <span class="bold">did great wonders and miracles among the people.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And <span class="bold">all</span> that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, <span class="bold">saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</span></p>

When they arrived, Peter started talking, the Holy Ghost fell on everyone, and they all lived happily ever after. (Or something like that.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the Lord Jesus.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world: which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="act12-7">7 And, behold, <span class="bold">the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side</span>, and raised him up, <span class="bold">saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(12.7) <span class="bold">“The angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side … saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.”</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(12.8) <span class="bold">“The angel said unto him, Gird thyself … and follow me.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 When they were past the first and the second ward, <span class="bold">they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord</span>: and they went out, and passed on through one street; <span class="bold">and forthwith the angel departed from him.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(12.10) “They came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord … and forthwith the angel departed from him.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And they said unto her, <span class="bold">Thou art mad</span>. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, <span class="bold">It is his angel.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (12.15) “Thou art mad … It is his angel.” When Peter shows up after the angel breaks him out of prison, the other believers don’t believe it. They think it’s “his angel” instead. (Peter had an angel that looked just like him.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And <span class="bold">Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon</span>: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king’s chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s country.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (12.20) <span class="bold">“Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon.”</span> Ezekiel (26.14, 21; 27.36) prophesied that Tyre would be completely destroyed by Nebuchadrezzar, never to be built again. Yet it wasn’t destroyed, as is evident from this verse.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="act12-21">21 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And the multitude rose up together against them: and <span class="bold">the magistrates rent off their clothes</span>, and commanded to beat them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="act17-5">5 But <span class="bold">the Jews which believed not, moved with envy</span>, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="act17-13">13 But when <span class="bold">the Jews of Thessalonica</span> had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and <span class="bold">stirred up the people.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Then certain <span class="bold">philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him.

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">21 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">35 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">36 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">37 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">39 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">40 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which have a vow on them;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">24 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 When the centurion heard that, he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this man is a Roman.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1040">ACTS 23</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="act23-1"><span class="drop-cap1">23</span> And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 <span class="bold">Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall</span>: for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00029.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (23.3) <span class="bold">“Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall.”</span> (Paul has kind words for everyone.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And <span class="bold">the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul</span>: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear witness also at Rome.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (23.11) “The night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul.” The Lord (Jesus?) stopped by to chat with Paul.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="act23-12">12 And when it was day, certain of <span class="bold">the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(23.12) <span class="bold">“The Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And <span class="bold">they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(23.14) <span class="bold">“They came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him: and <span class="bold">we</span>, or ever he come near, <span class="bold">are ready to kill him</span>.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(23.15) <span class="bold">“We … are ready to kill him.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And he wrote a letter after this manner:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="act23-27">27 <span class="bold">This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then</span> came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00027.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (23.27) <span class="bold">“This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then … I … rescued him.</span>” Claudius saves Paul from being killed by the Jews.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">28 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">34 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">35 I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1041">ACTS 24</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="act24-1"><span class="drop-cap1">24</span> And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="act24-15">15 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that <span class="bold">there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(24.15) <span class="bold">“There shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.”</span><br class="calibre9"/>
  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con33">33 Has the ever been a just person?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had ought against me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1042">ACTS 25</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="act25-1"><span class="drop-cap1">25</span> Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.</p>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_1043">ACTS 26</h4>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="act26-1"><span class="drop-cap1">26</span> Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let her drive.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (27.22-24) Paul tells his sailing companions not to fear. He has an angel onboard that will protect them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">22 And now <span class="bold">I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you</span>, but of the ship.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(27.22) <span class="bold">“I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man’s life among you.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">23 <span class="bold">For there stood by me this night the angel</span> of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(27.23) <span class="bold">“For there stood by me this night the angel.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">24 <span class="bold">Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(27.24) <span class="bold">“Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">39 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">42 And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea, and get to land:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">44 And the rest, some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="act28-1"><span class="drop-cap1">28</span> And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (28.3-6) Paul is bitten by a poisonous snake and yet lives. The “barbarians” who were shipwrecked with him thought he must be a murderer since he was bitten; but then they changed their minds and thought him to be a god since he didn’t die. (The snake story is especially interesting since there are no poisonous snakes on Malta, and there is no evidence of their existence in the past.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="act28-3">3 And <span class="bold">when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(28.5) <span class="bold">“He shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 Howbeit they looked when <span class="bold">he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they</span> had looked a great while, and <span class="bold">saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as <span class="bold">concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (28.22) <span class="bold">“Concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.”</span> The Jews of Rome refer to Paul’s new religion as a sect.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
