  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">I will sell your sons and your daughters … for the LORD hath spoken it.</i> — <span class="small">Joel 3.8</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">There’s not much to report from Joel. God will burn forests and dry up rivers, send locusts and caterpillars to eat crops, darken the sun, turn the moon to blood, and sell sons and daughters into slavery. But if you’ve read the earlier books in the Old Testament, you’re used to all that by now. The only thing new is that it will all happen soon. Really soon. (It was supposed to have happened soon after Joel was written, so it’s a bit overdue.)</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are some highlights:</p>
