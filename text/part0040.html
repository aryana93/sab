  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">We have heard a rumour from the Lord.</i> — <span class="small">Obadiah 1</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">It’s amazing how much bad stuff can be packed into the Bible. There are only 21 verses in Obadiah, for example, but somehow it manages to include:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">The Israelites hear “a rumor from the Lord” telling them to start a war with the Edomites. <a href="part0040.html#oba1-1">1</a>, <a href="part0040.html#oba1-8">8</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God tells Israelites to “destroy the wise men out of Edom” and to slaughter “everyone of the mount of Esau.” <a href="part0040.html#oba1-8">8-9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“The day of the Lord is near.” If so, it must have come and past, unnoticed, long before the birth of Jesus. <a href="part0040.html#oba1-15">15</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God will burn all the heathen to death, “for the LORD hath spoken it.” <a href="part0040.html#oba1-16">16-18</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art greatly despised.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden things sought up!</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="oba1-15">15 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head.</p>
