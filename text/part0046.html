  <p class="noindent2">The God of Haggai is an active God. He blows houses down, sends drought and hail, shakes heaven and earth, sea and dry land. Yet for some reason the Israelites still didn’t like him too much. Weird, eh?</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are the highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">God huffs, and he puffs, and he blows the house down! <a href="part0046.html#hagg1-9">1.9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">After God blew the houses down, the Israelites repaired their houses while ignoring the temple. So God sent a drought to punish them. <a href="part0046.html#hagg1-9">1.9-11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">In “a little while” God “will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.” <a href="part0046.html#hagg2-6">2.6</a>, <a href="part0046.html#hagg2-21">2.21</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.” <a href="part0046.html#hagg2-8">2.8</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Be careful not to let any holy flesh touch any food or wine, because if you do your flesh won’t be holy any more. <a href="part0046.html#hagg2-12">2.12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God sent blasting, mildew, and hail upon the Israelites, yet they still didn’t return to him. <a href="part0046.html#hagg2-17">2.17</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He will make the horses and their riders be killed by “the sword of his brother.” <a href="part0046.html#hagg2-22">2.22</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.1, 15; 2.1, 10, 18, 20) It sounds so much more prophet-like when we are told the year, month, and day of some prophetic nonsense.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="hagg1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not come, the time that the LORD’S house should be built.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this house lie waste?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.8) “Build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.” God wanted a nice, fancy house to take pleasure in and be glorified in.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.9-11) But the Israelites repaired their own houses while ignoring the temple. So God huffed, and he puffed, and he blew on the land, thereby bringing a drought to punish them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="hagg1-9">9 Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.10) <span class="bold">“The the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth is stayed from her fruit.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.11) <span class="bold">“And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the hands.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Then spake Haggai the LORD’S messenger in the LORD’S message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the people, saying,</p>

He’ll shake until “the desire of the nations” comes and his house is filled with glory. But if any gold or silver is shaken lose, it’s all God’s.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="hagg2-6">6 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.6) <span class="bold">“I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">9 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.9) <span class="bold">“The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former … and in this place will I give peace.”</span> God will have more glory than ever when he is settled into his new house, and he might even give some peace.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="hagg2-11">11 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.12-14) God has a conversation with Haggai and the priests about holy flesh, skirts touching bread or wine, the cleanliness of dead bodies, and whatnot. The main thing to remember here is this: Don’t let your holy flesh touch any food or wine, because if you do your flesh won’t be holy any more.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="hagg2-12">12 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.12) <span class="bold">“If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy?”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.13) <span class="bold">“If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean?”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="hagg2-17">17 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD.</p>

What is wrong with people?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">18 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD’S temple was laid, consider it.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.18) Consider this<span class="bold">: “Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the LORD’s temple was laid, consider it.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth: from this day will I bless you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,</p>
