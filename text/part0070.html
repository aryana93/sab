  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</i> — <span class="small">1 Peter 2.18</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">The author claims to be the apostle Peter (1:1), but most scholars think it was forged. Illiterate (Acts <a href="part0054.html#act4-13">4.13</a>), Aramaic-speaking, first century, Palestinian Jews didn’t write letters in Greek.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">There are a few things in First Peter that should be of interest to skeptics.

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 But <span class="bold">let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</p>
