  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words.</i> — <span class="small">3 John 10</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">If you measure by the number of words, 3 John is the shortest book in the Bible. There’s not much to say about it, since it doesn’t say very much.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are a few highlights (if you can call them that):</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">“I will remember his [Diotrephes] deeds ... pratting against us with malicious words.” <a href="part0074.html#johnc1-10">10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.” <a href="part0074.html#johnc1-11">11a</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.” <a href="part0074.html#johnc1-11">11b</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="johnc1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="johnc1-10">10 Wherefore, if I come, <span class="bold">I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words</span>: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="johnc1-11">11 Beloved, <span class="bold">follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00028.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (11a) “Follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.” Do good. Avoid evil.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.</p>
