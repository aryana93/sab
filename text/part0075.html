  <h3 class="chaph1" id="chap65">JUDE</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">To convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken.</i> — <span class="small">Jude 15</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">The author claims to be “Jude, the brother of James,” which, if true (which it wasn’t, of course), would make him the brother of Jesus, too, since “the Lord’s brother” (<a href="part0058.html#gala1-19">Gal 1.19</a>) was the most famous James among believers at the time.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">No one knows who wrote this epistle, but whoever it was liked to call people names. Ungodly men ordained to condemnation, filthy dreamers, defilers of the flesh, ungodly sinners, murmurers, complainers, mockers walking in their own ungodly lusts—all in just 25 verses!</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are some highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="jude1-14">14 And <span class="bold">Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 <span class="bold">These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts</span>; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having men’s persons in admiration because of advantage.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00029.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (16) <span class="bold">“These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="jude1-17">17 But, beloved, <span class="bold">remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles</span> of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00019.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (17) <span class="bold">“Remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles.”</span> Jude was written in post-apostolic times, so it’s author could not have been the apostle Jude (<a href="part0052_split_000.html#luke6-16">Luke 6:16</a>; <a href="part0054.html#act1-13">Acts 1:13</a>; cf <a href="part0053.html#john14-22">John 14:22</a>) as believers sometimes claim.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">18 How <span class="bold">that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00020.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (18) <span class="bold">“That they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.”</span> The author of Jude thought he was living in “the last time.”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 <span class="bold">And of some have compassion, making a difference</span>:</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00028.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (22) <span class="bold">“And of some have compassion, making a difference.”</span> Make a difference in the world by having some compassion.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">23 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.</p>
