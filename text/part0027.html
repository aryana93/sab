  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it</i>. — <span class="small">Job 1.7</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">The Book of Job gets way too much credit from both believers and skeptics. Everyone, it seems, thinks it inspiring and profound, especially those who have never read it. But Job is, in fact, as silly as it is evil. Let me summarize it for you.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">God and Satan play a game with the lives of Job and his family. Satan bets that Job will curse God to his face if Job’s life is made unpleasant enough. So God (or Satan, it’s hard to tell them apart) kills Job’s children and sends various torments upon him. Although Job curses the day he was born and says some nasty (and true) things about God, he doesn’t curse God (as he should have), so he is rewarded with new, even better, children. Another happy ending!</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here’s a summary:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">Job was a perfect man, the richest in all the east. He had seven sons, three daughters, thousands of animals, and many slaves. <a href="part0027.html#job1-1">1.1-4</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God makes a bet with his son, Satan. God tells Satan to do nasty things to Job to see if he can get him to curse God to his face. <a href="part0027.html#job1-6">1.6-12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He kills (or allows Satan to kill) Job’s children, but Job doesn’t “foolishly” blame God. <a href="part0027.html#job1-20">1.20-22</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He allows Satan to torment Job, just to see how he will react. <a href="part0027.html#job2-3">2.3-7</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">He gives Job to Satan, saying: “Behold, all that he hath is in thy power.” <a href="part0027.html#job2-6">2.6</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Satan (or God) smites Job with boils from the “sole of his foot unto his crown.” <a href="part0027.html#job2-7">2.7</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Job’s wife says that to retain his integrity he should “curse God and die.” <a href="part0027.html#job2-9">2.9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Job curses the day he was born. <a href="part0027.html#job3-1">3.1-2</a>, <a href="part0027.html#job3-11">3.11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God multiplies wounds without cause, destroys the perfect along with the wicked, laughs at the trial of the innocent, and hides the truth from judges. <a href="part0027.html#job9-17">9.17-24</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">After God and Satan get done tormenting Job, God gave Job even more stuff than he had before, including children. God gave Job another set of 10 kids, with even prettier daughters! <a href="part0027.html#job42-13">42.13-15</a><br class="calibre9"/></li>

  <h4 class="subhb2a" id="toc_id_436">JOB 1</h4>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (1.1-4) Job was a perfect man, the richest in all the east. He had 7 sons and 3 daughters that liked to party. The sons often invited their sisters over to party with them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="job1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> <span class="bold">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect</span> and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.1) <span class="bold">“There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect.”</span> Nobody’s perfect. Well, except for Job (and Noah).</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 And <span class="bold">there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.2) <span class="bold">“There were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 <span class="bold">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(1.3) <span class="bold">“His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">4 And <span class="bold">his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text" id="job1-4">(1.4) <span class="bold">“His sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 <span class="bold">And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power</span>; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. <span class="bold">So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and <span class="bold">they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads</span> toward heaven.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="job32-1"><span class="drop-cap1">32</span> So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</p>

They are, in fact, careful and attentive parents. The male scoops out a hollow for the eggs, which are incubated by the females during the day and by the darker colored male at night, an arrangement that helps to conceal them from foes. After the eggs are hatched, they are cared for by the mother for over a month, at which time the chicks can keep up with running adults.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">11 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">29 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">30 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">31 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">32 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">33 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">34 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="job42-1"><span class="drop-cap1">42</span> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="job42-2">2 <span class="bold">I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(42.2) <span class="bold">“I know that thou canst do every thing and that no thought can be withholden from thee.”</span><br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">3 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="job42-5">5 <span class="bold">I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.</span></p>

  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con49">49 Can God be seen?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">7 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="job42-11">11 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over <span class="bold">all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him</span>: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (42.11) <span class="bold">“All the evil that the LORD had brought upon him”</span><br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 <span class="bold">So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(42.12) <span class="bold">“So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="job42-13">13 <span class="bold">He had also seven sons and three daughters</span>.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 <span class="bold">And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job</span>: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</p>

God gave Job another set of 10 kids, with even prettier daughters! (This is where Job’s Daughters International comes from.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 <span class="bold">After this lived Job an hundred and forty years</span>, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations.</p>
