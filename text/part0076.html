  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">The time is at hand.</i> — <span class="small">Revelation 1.3, 22.10</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Everything in Revelation should probably be highlighted, because it’s all violent, cruel, or absurd in one way or another. But that would make it too hard to read, and it’s hard enough as it is.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Revelation has my vote for the worst book in the Bible. And since the Bible, Quran, and the Book of Mormon are the three worst books ever written, that’s saying something.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are some highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">John believes “the time is at hand,” and that the things that he writes about in Revelation will “shortly come to pass.” <a href="part0076.html#rev1-1">1.1</a>, <a href="part0076.html#rev1-3">3</a>; <a href="part0076.html#rev22-10">22.10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Jesus has white hair, eyes of fire, feet of brass, and has a sword sticking out of his mouth. <a href="part0076.html#rev1-13">1.13-16</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Four angels, with an army of 200 million, killed a third of the earth’s population. <a href="part0076.html#rev9-15">9.15-19</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">God will send an earthquake that will kill 7000 people. <a href="part0076.html#rev11-13">11.13</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“There was a war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon.” Even in heaven, you can’t be safe from war or dragons. <a href="part0076.html#rev12-7">12.7</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Those who receive the mark of the beast will “drink of the wine of the wrath of God … and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone … and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever.” <a href="part0076.html#rev14-10">14.10-11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Whoever isn’t found listed in the book of life, along with the fearful or unbelieving, will be cast into the lake of fire. <a href="part0076.html#rev20-15">20.15</a>, <a href="part0076.html#rev21-8">21.8</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Anyone who adds to the words in Revelation (or to the rest of the Bible?) will be struck with plagues, and anyone that tries to remove anything from it will have his name removed from the book of life. <a href="part0076.html#rev22-18">22.18-19</a></li>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.1-7) <span class="bold">To the angel of the church of Ephesus</span><br class="calibre9"/>
  Jesus has something against the church of Ephesus. It left its first love and unless it repents, he will take away its candlestick. Still, Jesus and Ephesus have something in common: they hate the deeds of Nicolaitanes. Whoever overcomes, will get the tree of life.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="rev2-1"><span class="drop-cap">2</span> Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; <span class="bold">These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks</span>;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">2 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Nevertheless <span class="bold">I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.4) <span class="bold">“I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">5 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else <span class="bold">I will</span> come unto thee quickly, and will <span class="bold">remove thy candlestick</span> out of his place, <span class="bold">except thou repent.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.5) <span class="bold">“I will … remove thy candlestick … except thou repent.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 But this thou hast, that <span class="bold">thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.6) <span class="bold">“Thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; <span class="bold">To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life</span>, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><span class="bold">(2.7) “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00027.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00022.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00029.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.9-11) <span class="bold">To the angel of the church in Smyrna</span><br class="calibre9"/>
  Jesus knows all about those blaspheming false Jews who are card-carrying members of the synagogue of Satan. Those that overcome will not be hurt by the second death.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2" id="rev2-9">9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and <span class="bold">I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><span class="bold">(2.9) “I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><span class="bold">(2.11) “He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</p>

  Jesus knows where Satan lives: the town of Pergamos! And Jesus has a few things against that town, too. There was that stuff a while back with Balaam and Balac, eating things sacrificed to idols, fornication, and whatnot. But what he really hates is the doctrine of Nicolaitanes. Repent or Jesus will fight with the sword that sticks out of his mouth. Whoever overcomes will get some manna to eat, along with a white stone with their own secret name written on it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">13 <span class="bold">I know</span> thy works, and where thou dwellest, <span class="bold">even where Satan’s seat is</span>: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain <span class="bold">among you, where Satan dwelleth.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><span class="bold">(2.13) “I know … even where Satan’s seat is … Among you, where Satan dwelleth.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 But <span class="bold">I have a few things against thee</span>, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><span class="bold">(2.14) “I have a few things against thee.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">15 <span class="bold">So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><span class="bold">(2.15) “So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">16 <span class="bold">Repent; or else I</span> will come unto thee quickly, and <span class="bold">will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><span class="bold">(2.16) “Repent; or else I … will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.”</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; <span class="bold">To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name</span> written, <span class="bold">which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><span class="bold">(2.17) “To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name … which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.”</span></p>

  Jesus has a few things against Thyatira, too. Jezebel has taught them to fornicate and eat things sacrificed to idols. So Jesus will throw Jezebel and her sex partners into a bed of torture. Then he’ll kill her children (with death). Whoever overcomes will rule everyone else with an iron rod, smashing the others to pieces. Jesus will even throw in the morning star (the planet Venus?) as a bonus prize.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">18 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; <span class="bold">These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">19 I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 Notwithstanding <span class="bold">I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel</span>, which calleth herself a prophetess, <span class="bold">to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication</span>, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</p>

Until “the lion of the tribe of Judah” gave it a try. He opened the seals with no problem and then transformed into a 7-eyed, 7-horned, dead lamb with the 7 Spirits of God. The point is, I guess, that both the lion and the lamb are really Jesus, and only he (they?) have the strength to break the seals.
