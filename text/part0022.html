  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon.</i> — <span class="small">1 Chronicles 20.3</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">The first nine chapters of First Chronicles are good examples of the “endless genealogies” that the New Testament tells us to avoid (see <a href="part0064.html#tim1-4">1 Timothy 1.4</a> and <a href="part0066.html#titu3-9">Titus 3.9</a>). Wearisome as these chapters are, the rest of the book isn’t much better. Consequently, First Chronicles is probably the most boring book in the Bible—maybe the most boring book in all of literature.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">First Chronicles covers the same material that is covered elsewhere in the Bible, adding a lot of contradictions while making it even more boring.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Highlights (such as they are):</p>

For a punishment, he offers him three choices: Three years of famine, three months to be destroyed by enemies, or three days of pestilence. When David can’t make up his mind, God decides for him and sends a pestilence that kills 70,000 men. (Presumably women and children were also killed. If so, the total must have been more than 200,000.) In the middle of the slaughter, God “repents of the evil” that he was doing and tells the angel to stop the killing. One wonders what God had in mind in the first place, since it was David who was supposed to have sinned by taking the census—not the people. Even David was confused by this, and asked God, “these sheep, what have they done?”</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the LORD.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="chron29-1"><span class="drop-cap1">29</span> Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses withal:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the LORD?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">6 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king’s work, offered willingly,</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00018.jpeg" class="calibre"/> <img alt="" src="../images/00016.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (29.7) <span class="bold">“Gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron”</span> King David collects ten thousand drams (or darics) for the construction of the temple in Jerusalem. This is especially interesting since darics were coins named after King Darius I who lived some five hundred years after David.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text1">As usual, the reported amounts of gold, silver, and iron are grossly exaggerated. (5000 talents of gold, for example, would be about 150,000 kilograms, which would be worth about 8.4 billion US dollars in today’s market.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 And gave for the service of the house of God of <span class="bold">gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="chron29-11">11 Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for <span class="bold">all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine</span>; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">12 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine own.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">22 And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</p>
