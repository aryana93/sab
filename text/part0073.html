  <h3 class="chaph1" id="chap63">2 JOHN</h3>

  <p class="noindent">If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed. — <span class="small">2 John 10</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">Second John is an interesting little epistle. It reminds Christians to “love one another,” while shunning everyone else. Believers are to associate only with like-minded believers; all others are godless antichrists that true-believers shouldn’t even say “Howdy” to.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Here are some highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">“Love one another.” Except for all those antichrists (non-Christians), that is. Stay the hell away from them. (See verses <a href="part0073.html#johnb1-7">7-10</a>) <a href="part0073.html#johnb1-5">5</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Non-Christians are deceivers and antichrists. <a href="part0073.html#johnb1-7">7</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Whosoever … abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.” <a href="part0073.html#johnb1-9">9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Don’t associate with non-Christians. Don’t receive them into your house or even exchange greeting with them. <a href="part0073.html#johnb1-10">10</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Bible-Text" id="johnb1-1"><span class="drop-cap">1</span> The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">2 For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="johnb1-5">5 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we <span class="bold">love one another.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00028.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (5) <span class="bold">“Love one another.”</span> Except for all those antichrists (non-Christians), that is. Stay the hell away from them. (See verses 7-10)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">6 And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="johnb1-7">7 For <span class="bold">many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</span></p>

This is a deceiver and an antichrist.” Non-Christians are deceivers and antichrists.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">8 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="johnb1-9">9 <span class="bold">Whosoever</span> transgresseth, and <span class="bold">abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.</span> He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</p>
