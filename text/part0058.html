  <p class="noindent"><i class="italic">I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</i> — <span class="small">Galatians 5.12</span></p>

  <p class="noindent2">There’s a lot of cursing going on in Galatians. First Paul curses all those who disagree with him (<a href="part0058.html#gala1-8">1.8-9</a>). Then he curses the Jews (<a href="part0058.html#gala3-10">3.10</a>). Not even Jesus escapes Paul’s curse (3.13). But the part I like best is where he wishes his opponents would castrate themselves (<a href="part0058.html#gala5-12">5.12</a>). Fun stuff.</p>

  <p class="noindent3">Galatians Highlights:</p>

  <ul class="calibre7">
    <li class="calibre8">If anyone dares to disagree with Paul on religious matters, “let him be accursed.” <a href="part0058.html#gala1-8">1.8-9</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Those who try to follow the law are cursed <a href="part0058.html#gala3-10">3.10</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Jesus was cursed by God. <a href="part0058.html#gala3-13">3.13</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.” <a href="part0058.html#gala5-2">5.2</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“I would they were even cut off which trouble you.” (The New Revised Standard Version translates this verse as: “I wish those who unsettle you would castrate themselves!”) <a href="part0058.html#gala5-12">5.12</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">Witches, idol worshippers, and heretics will not go to heaven. (Guess where they’ll be going.) <a href="part0058.html#gala5-20">5.20-21</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“See how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.” <a href="part0058.html#gala6-11">6.11</a></li>

    <li class="calibre8">“Many … desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.” <a href="part0058.html#gala6-12">6.12-13</a></li>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gala2-2">2 And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which <span class="bold">I preach among the Gentiles</span>, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gala2-6">6 But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: <span class="bold">God accepteth no man’s person</span>:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:</p>

  <img alt="" src="../images/00017.jpeg" class="calibre"/><a href="part0077.html#con21">21 Does God respect anyone?</a></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">7 But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">8 (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">9 And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">10 Only they would that we should <span class="bold">remember the poor</span>; the same which I also was forward to do.</p>

  <p class="Notes-Text"><img alt="" src="../images/00028.jpeg" class="calibre"/> (2.10) “Remember the poor.” (And help them if you can.)</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">11 But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">12 For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gala2-16">16 Knowing that <span class="bold">a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ</span>, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: <span class="bold">for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</span></p>

  <p class="Notes-Text">(2.16) “A man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ … for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.”<br class="calibre9"/>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">17 But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">14 That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gala3-16">16 Now to <span class="bold">Abraham</span> and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, <span class="bold">And to thy seed, which is Christ.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gala3-19">19 Wherefore then serveth <span class="bold">the law</span>? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it <span class="bold">was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.</span></p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">3 Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">4 But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">5 To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">13 Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">14 And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">15 Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">16 Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">17 They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">18 But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">19 My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">20 I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">21 Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1" id="gala4-22">22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text2">23 But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">24 Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">25 For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">26 But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">27 For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.</p>

  <p class="Bible-Text1">28 Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</p>
